For a long time ago, I visited Europe with my family in a group led by a tour guide.  Although my family payed a great deal of money, we enjoyed the travel since the travel was convenient and helpful for increasing our knowledge. Like my case, people should notice that the best way to travel is in a groups led by the tour guide.

First of all, since the tour guide provides enough knowledge and information to people, it is the best way to travel in a group led by the tour guide. There are two purposes of travel. One is to have a rest and the other is to earn information related coutries or places that people travel. When people travel to acquire knowledge, they need  professional guide as it is hard to get information about certain places by their own power. In contrast, when people travel without the tour guide, they will sightsee without getting information and this will not be beneficial for increasing their knowledge.

Safety of the tour guide also makes the tour guide more attractive. The foreign countries or places that people have not visited can be dangerous to people since they can not know factors that can be harmful. Therefore, people who travel alone sometimes get in troubles. For example, I heard news that one traveler who visited the foreign countries alone was kidnapped. Thus, to decrease the risk of travel, people should travel in a groups led by the tour guide that has been guided people for a long time and has bountiful knowledge about the dangerous factors, so the tour guide can make the travelers to travel safely.

Finally, the travelers do not need to concern about their travel plans, if they travel in a groups led by the tour guide. When people plan to travel alone. they have to consider various factors. They have to arrange hotels that they will stay and they have to purchase airplane tickets. Also, they have to plan their schedule and choose where to visit to see. However, people who travel in a group by the tour guide do not need to worry about these factors because tour guide companies plan everything. What the travelers have to do is just to pay money.

To sum up, the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by the tour guide because people can earn knowledge properly and travel safely. In addition, people do not have to endeavor to make plans.
