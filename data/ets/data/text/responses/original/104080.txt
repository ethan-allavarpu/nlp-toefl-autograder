   In today's world, cars are the main kind of transportation used for transportation on land. As the cities grow and distances get longer, people need ways of transportation  more and more in everyday life. Therefore, nowadays almost every person that can afford it over 18 and has a lincence owns a car. If you consider the number of people living on this planet, that would make quite a number. However, on the other hand, ways of public transportation are developing, which reduces the necessity for cars. So what will happen in twenty years?
   First of all, there is the fact that to get from one place to another, you need to have a way of transportation. For most people, in the large cities they live in today, it is impossible to get to work or to go shopping or anywhere within walking distance. So, they need to have a car or a way of public transportation. Most people prefer having there own cars and it's easy to see why: methods of public transportation are slow and unreliable. You never know when the bus is going to come and it's almost certain that you will be late to wherever you're going. Also, buses go slow and stop many times for passengers to get on and off. Metros are usually very crowded and it is very uncomfortable to travel squeezed against people that you don't even know. Taxis are usually very expensive. Plus, if you go grocery shopping, there is no way you can carry all your bags unless you have a trunk to put them into. Picture yourself in a crowded bus or metro with ten bags full of heavy fruits and vegetables, gallons of milk and juice, meat that is about to get spoiled and ice cream that is melting all over the floor. Not very conveniant, nor is it going to work. This is an example of why at least one car is needen for every family.
   However, there is the growing problem of pollution and traffic. There are so many cars that it takes you an hour to get home during rush hour when it usually takes fifteen minutes. Plus, when you get to work, or the mall, there is always the problem of parking. Wouldn't it just be great to go and catch a movie or get a bite to eat in the time you use looking for parking spaces? That is why shopping malls and working places have started to schedule service buses which will take you directly from home to work or wherever you are going. Also, there is the problem of the oil resources running out, and put that aside, cars heavily pollute the air. So, instead of twenty people going to a place in separate cars, imagine how much it would reduce pollution and traffic if all twenty people used a bus to go there. 
   My opinion is that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty years. Governments that are aware of the pollution and traffic problem are developing methods of public transportation to encourage their people to use those methods instead of cars. For example, in the United States, carpool lanes have been arranged in big cities like Los Angeles which you can use only if you have more than one passanger in your car. So, in my opinion, the rising public awareness of pollution, the raise in the cost for fuel for cars and the development in public transportation will reduce the number of cars in the future.
