Many people have the problem that they do not know what to do regarding the subjects they can choose form, in a universtiy. Should they take their time to study many acadamic subjects or should they specialize in one specific subject?

The first positive point of choosing many academic subjects is, that you have a broad knowledge of many different thinks. That makes you more flexible when you look for a new job and also gives you more flexibility on many other situations. The second positive fact is that you are able to talk about many different topics, which can help you to increase your relationships with others. If a person talks about various  topics you are able to enter the conversation because of the fact that you have more knowledge about different thinks. You are able to talk about many differnt thinks than a person who just study one specific subject. 

To specialize on one specific subject has many positive benefits. First of all people who take many courses have not specific knowledge about a certain subject. People who specialize on one subject are more professional and therefore able to answer more specific questions because they have more knowlede. They are also able to use their knowledge to solve higher problems. Another positiv fact is that companies allways need professional people who have a lot of knowlede in a specific area. Therefore people are better paid than people who are not so professional. 

I strongly belive that it is better to have more knowledge about a specific subject. You are more able to solve complex porblems and you are also able to answer to more specific questions. In addition people with more knowledge about a topic are more likley to get more money from companies because they need professional people.
