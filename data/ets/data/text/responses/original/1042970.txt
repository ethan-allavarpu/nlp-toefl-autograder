I agree the statement. I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
There are a reason to support my answer.
Facts are results of ideas and concepts.Good ideal and concept make good facts. However, bad ideas and concepts meke bad facts. So,if students understand ideas and concepts exactly, they can understand why the facts are maked. 
In conclusion, I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learnning facts.
