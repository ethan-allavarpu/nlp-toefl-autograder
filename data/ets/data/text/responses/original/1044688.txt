Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for many reasons. First, trying new things gives you an opportunity to learn more,for example,learning to drive can make you focus more and see more.In addition, you can be more experianced when you take the risk and try new things, the more you try the more feeling that you get that you have no limitations in what you can do, the more experinced you get. Lets take the CEO's of the big companies for example, if they did not try new thing and if they did not take risks, they definatlly would not be where they are now. Third, trying new things and taking risks makes you more ready to solve problems.

     On the other hand,not having the guts to try new thing and take risks could concequence in beeing in the same position for a long time if not for ever,. Yuo will do your thing right, but you will do it for ever. In conclusion, dont limit your self, dont underestemait your self, go out there and try new things and take the risk.
