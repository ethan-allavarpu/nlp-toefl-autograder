Cars are of vital importance for everyone's life. Today, we cannot imagine a situation without cars. Even if we do not have one ourselves, other people utilize them to make our lives easier - be it a transporter bringing food to the supermarket or the car that brings us to the hospital in case of a severe accident.

In my opinion, we need cars and the populatoin in our country knows that. This is the reason why I think that the number of cars will not diminish in the next 20 years.

There are a myriad of arguments for and against the use of cars:
The major argument against cars is certainly the pollution of our environment. And it is true - cars, as we know them today, need certain natural resources and do pollute our environment to a certain degree. If this is always true, there will probably be fewer cars in use in 20 years that there are today. At some point in time, people would recognize the harm of cars and would definitely try to reduce the number of cars to protect the environment.

But this may not be a realistic case: I am of the opinion, that our scientists get smarter and smarter. Until today, they already invented hybrid engines and engines that are only run by solar energy or plant oils. Today, those inventions cannot replace cars that need gaz to produce power, because scientists are still trying to get more out of the new foundings. But consider the time the gaz engine needed to be as perfect as we know today: It took long years for the car industry to be able to produce those engines. 

Given this evolution, it is possible and very realistic that our scientists will make a huge contribution to the improvement of the 'new' engines in the next 20 years. Even if 20 years might be too short to develop a car that does not pollute the environment at all, I think that the scientists are on a good way to find an engine that drastically reduces the pollution. And after another 20 years, we might already use cars that do not need any natural resources like gaz. If this is the case, everyone will recognize the outstanding advantages of cars, so that the number of cars will rather increase.
