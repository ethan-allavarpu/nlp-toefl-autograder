YES,i agree this statement,"In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than the there are today".
         At present technology has been improved.At same time cars model are increased.In twenty years past there only two or three models of cars available.But present there are some models of cars and with technology cars are manufacturing.There will keep the people in safe mode even if accident will appear.
           For example in olden days there facility to see television in the car,listen music in the car.It used only for travelling purpose.But at present by reading newspaper also we can drive car. That much has been  improved the technology.If car has been accident there is no harm to the human beings because all safety has been arranged in the car.The old cars are polluting the climate so much by leaving smoke.But the present cars are using the gas instead of petro or disel.It will reduce pollution of climate.In past cars this facility is not available.Different cars have different technologies .At present populations also increased at same timeusage of car also incerased.
        Finally i conclude that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.At persent technology cars have good selling in the maarket.
