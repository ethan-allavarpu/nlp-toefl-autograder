In my personal experience, I've noticed that having a better knowledge of one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of a number of academic subjects. At the University I attended different courses referring to three main areas: History, Law and Economics. After my graduation I can say that I had a good knowledge of a series of academic subjects, but I realized that this was not so good for those who are searching a job, in particular the first job experience. In fact, like all my friends did after graduation, I began to search for a job. 
In trying to find something adequate to my generalistic preparation, I've understood that it is difficult for people who don't have a specialization to find a job, in particular a qualified job. 
Talking with some friends coming from Economic studies, they all told me that the labour market has notably changed in recent years. These changes took place since a strict division of work had become a necessity for companies and factories, for example. Consequently, it could be noticed that who offers a job is generally looking for qualified candidates, for people who have a high knowledge of a particular topic or, in better words, who is specialized in a specific subject. 
I have found that this is true, because all my friends who obtained a PhD or attended technical faculties have found a job in just a few months, while others with a more generalistic knowledge or university degree are still searching for a job. 
In conclusion I agree with those who prefer to specialize in a specific subject, because I think that in doing so, they could have more chances to find a job.
