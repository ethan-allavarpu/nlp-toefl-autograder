I agree with this statement which is that,"Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."
I feel this way because if we go for the products by just looking at the advertisements then we cannot really judge a product just by sitting at home and looking at an advertisement.

First reason that think that advertisements don't at all make products better than what they are,is that ,what we see cannot be true or a right thing most of the times.For example an adverisement on tv showing about a new car launched by some xyz company.Well to buy a car we really need to go out to a showroom and have a look at it as well as test drive it.But just by looking at an ad we can't predict the way in which a car would be handling at severe turns and bends.Well 

Secondly nowadays a lot of advertisemnt endorsing is done by popular faces like the actors sportsmen and so on.
Well i saw an advertisement of a bike recently on tv.This bike was endorsed by rising sportstar.In my hometown a lot of people by seeing this advertisement went to the showroom and bought that bike.Well i certainly know from the response from which iam hearing about the bike from my fellow friends is that the bike wasn't even worth a penny.
It was so poorly designed.The electronics the engine was the major problem concerning that bike.Now my friends are complaining to the dealer about their sorry state.So i do feel that by just following an advertisement one should not loose his normal senses and end up buying false products.

Additionally people who are making these advertisements about the products as well as those endorsing these products do they really use these products? Well it seems to be an interesting question.For example an actor in my hometown is endorsing a product of personal computer and laptops.But recently at a film production unit my friends did see him using a laptop of another brand.This means that he is sure that the product which he is endorsing is unreliable.Mostly we would not find all of the above people who make these advertisements,using these products.They would be using products from more famous brands and reputed ones.Hence we should not always look at an advertisement an buy the product.

In conlusion to the above mentioned points i firmly believe that todays advertisements are no more than a fake piece of information that is shown on television to make money out of the innocent people.Thus i believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
