The answer to this question depends of the situation that a particular person is at a time. In the case that the person does not know the city or place that is being visited, I would  recomend to contract a tour guide and doing it in a group because he is going to take you to the most important places in a quick, safe and with all the explanations needed to know the place that you are visiting, and  also you can enjoy the company of other people, giving you the oportunity to meet and share experiences. One of the most important things when you are traveling is to see the culture of the place, for example the food, dances, festivals, etc. and I think that a tour guide can help you to accomplish this goal, also the tour guide can give you historical information about the place which is very important when trying to understand the way the residents of the region visited behave.

On the other hand I think that if you have been before in the region and specially if you have been there for a couple times, hiring a tour giude is a waste of money and time, because this kind of services are usually expensive and  you can use that money in something more productive in you trip, also the tour guide is going to take you to places where you have  already  been.  Instead of that you can use that time to visit new places of the region, doing something different than your last visit.

So the conclusion for this is that it depends based on you previos experience on visiting the region. I will absolutly recomend so in the case that it is you first time, but if you have been before I do not see any reason to take a tour.
