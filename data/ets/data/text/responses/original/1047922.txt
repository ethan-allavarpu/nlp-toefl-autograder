I fully agree with the statement that succesful people try new things and take risks. In our everyday life, we have many examples that confirm this opinion, but the most important one is given by our interpreneurs.

Interpreneurs are always risking a lot in terms of money and time. Moreover, enterpreneurs are always innovating, trying new things in order to survive in the market, to be competitive, to improve their position on the global market. The main result of this behaviour is the success that everybody can recognize as tipical of enterpreneurs. 

On the other side, we have the low level employes. They only do what they have been teached to do at the beginning of their carreer and they do this work for all the life. Very often, this kind of people are really very good in doing some specific work and they usually work for all their life for the same Company. Generally, they never take any risk and the company fully protect and support them because they have a very strong know how. But if we analyse the lifes of these people we can see that they never achieve any success. 

To conclude, I think that to be succesful in the life, we need to take risks and try new things. Moreover, in this way we can keep alive our mind, we can train our creativity, we can better express ourself as human being. I think that we need to live as deep as possible our unique life, therefore we musttry as much as possible new things!
