Education is the cornerstone in our society, It's the main path that leads a person into the large, endless world of knowledge. Knowledge can be broad, as well as narrow. But which one is better to have?

To be able to answer this question properly, this topic will be divided into two parts: the undergraduate and the graduate students.

The undergradutate students will take a diversity of courses. This will provide them with a large opportunity that allows them to choose in which field to go later on. 

For example, in the first two years of the pre-pharmacy degree, we used to take, for instance, cultural study courses, arts courses, which are not related to pharmacy. And many students shifted their major after taking these courses. They found themselves brilliant in other fields. This diversity in courses, gave them the chance to choose the major that suits them the best. Imagine that the students take only major pharmacy courses from the first year. This could lead to the failure of many students, because they were not given the chance to study other courses. It's a serious situation, especially in the academic majors that are related to the public health and safety, such as medicine, pharmacy, engineering, etc... 

However, the graduate students don't have this problem. They decided to go through a specific field, after taking this diversity of courses, when they used to be undergraduate students. 

So, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will not last forever. And it's a complementary of the narrow knowledge.
