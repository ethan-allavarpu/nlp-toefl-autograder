It is undoubtedly true that in twenty years the number of circulating cars will be strongly reduced. Although many people may believe that this statement is simply ludicrous, It is possible to provide some good reasons to support it. Two main aspects of this explanation are the consequences of the environmental problems caused by cars and the problems caused by the constantly rising oil price.
      As everybody knows, cars produce toxic smoke that pollutes the air in big cities. For this reason many governments and city administrations are restricting the number of cars that are allowed to circulate in city centres. In the long term this will led to a change in citizen`s preferencies, i.e. they will prefer using public transportation to using their cars because it will become simply too difficult to drive a car in a big city. To support this opinion I could quote a research study on this topic carried out at my university that shows that people are becoming more and more unwilling to drive their cars in big cities.
       Another point that could be made is that having a car is becoming more and more expensive. The first reason for this phenomenon is that oil prices has become very prone to rise consistently at any threatened decrease in production. Grassroots people have already many economical problems and this one will become too awkward for them. Another thing that influence the cost of having a car is the fact that governments are discouraging cars buying by imposing taxes on some ecologically dangerous cars. For example the Italian government is willing to pass a law that imposes a tax on big cars.
        These two reasons given, itis not difficult to understand why I think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than
