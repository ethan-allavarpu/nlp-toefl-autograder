I totally agree with the statement given above. 

First of all, advertisements only show the advantages of a product and not the possible disadvantages. I made this experience for my own for quite a several times. I remember the first advertisements of the IPod from Apple. The customers really got the feeling, that the IPod was not only a simple music player in a good looking design, but even that it is the most handiest player on the market. I was one of the first people who bought an IPod but after a short period of time I was a little bit depressed about my decision. The advertisements did not show, that for example it was only possible to change the recorded music with one single software program and only one computer at once. I have still got the IPod, but in fututre I will be better informed about the features of a product, before I buy it.

Furthermore, quite a lot of products do not aim the characteristics in the way the advertisements show. A good friend of mine is working in the marketing business unit of a company, which is doing the advertising for different companies. It is allways very intersting and funny when we are getting together for a drink and talk about our jobs. Everytime it is the same that he tells me about new of his customers and their products. My friend and his collegues sometimes do not even see one advantage of a product which should be advertized by them, but it is their job to present the product in a kind of way that people have the desire to buy it.

As I have shown above, advertisements do not allways shows the truth about a product and put much better light on it than it is. I made these experiences for several times and I learned from this. I think everybody should be aware of, that the product she/he buys is  perhaps not as perfect as the advertisment of the product showed.
