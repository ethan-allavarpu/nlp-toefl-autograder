Many people have the opportinity to change the wold.Meanwhile others keep in the same way in theirs lives. I agree with the statement that says "successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well."
     Innovation is the key for succes.According to the news times, everything is changed  quickly .For example, the technology.We can find from simple calculators to moder satellites in the space.The new technology is given us the opportunity to learn faster and better. If you do not have new things the life will be dull .Thomas Alba Edison the great inventor for example invented more the fifty devices and gives the ligth.He changed the world forever.
      Innovation give us better quality of life.For example computers,you can use the media for many purposes,you can shopping,banking,learn and take TOEFLtest in the internet.It is becuause admirable people have innnovation and creativity.Not only in the technology area but also in the medicine field we have improving  our lives.Innovations permit that diseases that killed many people in the past  be cure with the new technology and knowledge.
      In conclusion ,i believe that innovation and risk improve the chances to have a bettre life. The time is now
