I completely aggree with the statement. Success is attained by forcing yourself to the limits, out of your confort zone, and conquering the challenge, whatever it may be. Through preparation and acumen, and utilizing what you have learned in your past experiences, stepping out of the confort zone and facing a challege directly, is the best way to increase stamina and tolerance that will help make you become stronger.

For example, being a martial art student and observing the successful moves of my mentor and chief instructor, I can confidently state that he practices for success. I met my instructor when he was merely a senior student, once he became the chief instructor and owner of the school, he revolutionized the curriculum to do things that had not been done before-this is getting out of your confort zone, knowing that you are doing well, but that you know you are capable of further success. The chief instructor decided to expand the curriculum and incorporate social activities that will benefit the people in the community. In order to do this he was forced to expand his staff on contract- this means that he committed to employ this staff for at least a year-, regardless of the outcome from the changes in the curriculum. To make the story short, the exposure to community activity increased the popularity of our school, and the respect, reputation, and profits that came along with. It would have been financially challenging for the school to have staff that would have not been needed, had the social activities addtion to the curriculom not succeeded-he would have thought of something though.The chief instructor was looking to be more successful through innovation and thinking out of the box, and in my opinion, he attained his goal.

Another example, and a more common one, is the introduction of Microsoft Windows as an operating system in 1990's. Before, Windows came all about, most operating systems were based on prompt and response and peole were used to it. Systems like DOS and Lunix that were monotonous, but worked well. Mr. Gates took a tremendous risk in creating a whole new interface to use in the computer, an interface that was more expensive and complex, but turned out to  be more effective and entertaining for most users. Nowadays, Windows is the most popular operating system. Taking risks means thinking out of the box, moreover, it takes courage and confidence, to materialize the idea. Mr. Gates, thought Windows would work, took steps to attain his goal, and succeeded.

In conclusion, trying new things, while risky, can improve the individual and the outcome through challenging out endurance and tolerance. No one says it will be easy, but if you are persistent enough, you will eventually succeed.
