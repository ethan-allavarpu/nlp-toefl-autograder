I mainly agree with that statement.
But it is important in which relationship this statement has to bee seen.
I think for example that it is correct if it is related to languages.
It is obvious better to speak  a little bit of english, french, german and italian than only one of them perfectly.
Concerning the profession I have to disagree with the statement. In today's economic situation it is better to be specified.
The unemployment is so high that it is possible to be well educated but yet unemployed if you are not specialized enough.
On the other hand a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects can be better, if you have to manage  for example your own firm and cannot rely on other specialists.
It is important to notice that a broad knowledge is the base for further knowledge in these areas. So if you do not have any variety of knowledge it is much harder to gain experiences in those unrevealed areas. Especially in the actual situation it is important to be flexible and to be willing to keep on learning during your whole lifetime. If you were a specialist in one certain subject  you probably would not be willing to listen to more actual information because of your status as specialist. 
It clearly depends on one's character but my oppinion is, that specialization is minor in contrast to a broad knowledge of many subjets. As I stated above the base is the most important thing. Afterwards there is still time to specialize certain subjects in which you are interested in. If you do not know all the possibilities you cannot be sure having chosen the right way.
I  would prefer a broad knowledge because then I stil have all possibilities. If I specialized and chose wrong, I would be dissapointed. 
You do not know how the future will be that is why specialization is such a dangerous thing. It is better to be eventually less qualified in a lot of subjects than to be specialized in one which no one needs.
So in general I would agree with the statement. Specialization comes after the broad base of many academic subjects.
