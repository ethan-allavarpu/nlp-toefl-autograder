	"Jack of all trades, master of none"
This is a saying a lot of us grew up listening to. The question is whether you want to be a Jack of all trades or the "King" of one. 
	Personally, I believe, that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to have broad, abstract knowledge about many. When you specialize in one subject, you gain a lot of knowledge and authority on that subject. This can lead to a lot of advantages.
	Firstly, mastery in one subject can help you with your career. If you have complete command over your subject, you can effectively utilize it to further your career goals. For example, in a competitive industry like the Information Technology industry, if you have a good grip on your domain, it will benefit you much more than having incomplete knowledge about a lot of other domains. If you are knowledgable about a subject, not only can you do your own work better, but you can also help your colleagues or peers with problems they may be facing.
	Specialization in a subject makes you an authority on it. This can lead to other people looking at you for direction or help if they are stuck. So not only do you become more popular, you also gain a lot of respect by helping others out.
	Lastly, i would say that if everyone just wanted to have broad knowledge on a variety of different subjects, then no scientific or other development would ever have been possible. Take Leonardo Da Vinci for example. Had he not developed his skill in painting to such a high degree, we would not today have been able to exclaim at the beauty of the Mona Lisa. Or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who with his skill in music, gave us so many beautiful compositions. Or Albest Einstein, whose immense study of scientific phenomena lead to so many inventions.
	In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is much better to specialize in a subject you feel passionately about than to have a lot of unimportant data on subjects you might be just mildly interested in.
