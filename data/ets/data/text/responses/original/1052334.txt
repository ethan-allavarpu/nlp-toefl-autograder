I think, the main point of inventing is curiosity. I absolutaly agree with this statement. Succesful people try new things and take risks rather tahn only ding what they already know how to do well. There are many charecteristics that make a person successful. Tenecity and intellenge are only two of these.

F?rstly, if a person has tenacity, he/she never gives up, never accepts 'no' for an answer. He/she studies hard to succeeds his/her goal. He is curious about his target. He does his best to achieve his goal for this target. He is so willing to learn new informations and making new inventions. For example, one of the great genious of our worlds is Einstein. He was a big inventor. And we are still using his theories in our classes. I think he gather his ambitions, intellegence and tenecity and form a person who will not be forget at any time of the world. 

Secondly, intellegence is a vey important factor that makes a person successful. If a person is intellegent, He/she can understand the problems easyly and does his/her best to cope with it. If people in our worlds do not be curious about new inventions, nothing could be found. For example, tecnology can not be improved widely, beneficial investigations about our era's diseas cancer can not be found. These are all beneficial to human beings. 

To sum up, nothing can be done without risking anything. The world is improving rapidly. People must always learn something to cope with these changes. They mustnot be frighten of the new improvement and new tecnology. Also, they must think 'what must I do to improve myself' instead of doing well what they already know. They have to do this not only for theirselves, also for the beneficial of all people around world.
