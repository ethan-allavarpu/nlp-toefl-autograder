First of all I would like to state that there can never be given 'enough' time to helping the local communities. Yet, by drawing comparisons between different communities all over the world I would like to present my home community in order to illustrate the youths' commitment to their communities.
For my working definition I see 'helping communities' as a willing and unpaid commitment in the local affairs.
There is a huge amount of youth groups covering all ages and interests which meet once a week in order to pursue their common interests and aims. There is a range from choirs to play groups to sports clubs. By coming together they foster the community, some arrange public events like summer parties where everybody can take part and the profit is being donated to local institutions.
Additionally, many youths willingly become members of e.g. firemen to be able to safe their families and neighbours when required. Weekly meetings and trainings prepare them for this task.
Moreover there are many who decide to be a social worker at least part-time, some even full-time for a whole year. They can work wherever they desire. Either they help in old peoples' homes by taking them for a walk, doing their shoppings or simply spend time with them. Others decide to work with disabled people. Helping them to manage their daily lives. Some others prefer to work with young children who have problems at home or at school etc. There is a variety of possibilities where they can and do spend their time in order to improve the conditions. 
Another possibility to get engaged in the community's affairs is to get engaged in the local politics. Thus, young people's ideas and suggestions can improve the community. For example I have just run a youths' campaign which informed the citizens about and collected signatures against the bad conditions in our local kindergarden. Soon we achieved the necessary pressure to achieve our demand.
