There are young people and older people who were enjoying their life. People who are young, they can go to school and  learn subjects and skills that is fun and importance to do. and they can make school friends (classmates) they can play or eating lunch together. So Young people can go to school.they can do any you want.If they graduated university, they can have a job. 
But older people were difficult to find jobs, so they can't do job anything they want. for example if old person who wants to work at slary, but this job have a limit of ages. or if old person take sporty job, like deliver to things. Older people not have enough power than younger people. But older people can living peacefuly, and young people have to working hard and they have no enough to spent time to reading novels at home, or watching TV. But older people can do. 
My grandmother is doing house jobs. She often goes to shopping and she likes to cook at home. She living peacefuly and enjoying her life.  But sometimes she thinks it's boring because, it's like she doing same thing every day. So, she saids that if she change to young people she can do jobs in actively. I thought it's agree to her opinion. 
One day I ask to grandmother to go Germanycome and enjoy with me. but she said she doesn't want to go, because maybe she going to be very tired and she doen't have power to go German. So, I decide to go many overseas when I was on young age.
