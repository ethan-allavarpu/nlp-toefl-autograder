It is commonly assumed that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Althought it might not be exact for every advertisements, this gap between reality and representation is experienced on a daily basis.

First, we have to keep in mind the primary goal of an advertisement,  which is to attract customers to a specific product. Hence, advertisement makers have to rely on commercial technics that give the impression that their product is  not only good, but that it is better than other products of the same category. 

It is precisely in this process that a gap may occure between what the product really is, and how it is presented to the customers. Even if we assume that the advertisement makers are aware of the basic qualities of a product, what is to be understood is that their goal is to make you think that you need this particular product, hence emphasizing it's qualities and of course passing under silence it's negative aspects. This unbalanced and biased view on the product inherent value will surely produce a distorted perception of it's real desirability, making it seem much better than it really is.

The car industry provides numerous examples of this phenomenon. This very competitive market forces advertisement makers to present every car as they are perfectly fitted for you, which is not always the case. For example, american car makers have the tendency to promote their vehicule by stating their durability and their power. But they naturally never mention the fact that these vehicules are much more energy-consuming than non-american cars. Hence, if one relies only on the advertisement, he will be conviced that this particular american automobile is a really good product. But, if he buys it, he will soon realize that his vehicule has a high gas consumption rate. He then might have the feeling that he made the wrong choice, that the vehicule was not as good for him as the advertisement pretented.This illustration shows clearly that advertisements are by definition enhancing the apparent value of a product in order to sell it.
