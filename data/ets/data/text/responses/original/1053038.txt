I totally disagree with the statement, even though oneself may believe that it is true to a certain extent because of the fact that young people love to play and no certain entity holds them responsible for their actions and the consequences of their actions. The following are the reasons and examples that explain why I strongly disagree with the statement mentioned in the question.
	Firstly, if we examine some of the extracurricular programs offered at elementary and high schools around the world, we will find that many of these programs are devoted to helping local communities. These programs include activities such as; cleaning side roads, collecting charitable donations and different socially responsible endeavours. Based on a research conducted by a leading consulting firm in Europe, it was shown that 5% of a young person's time is being dedicated to assisting their local communities.
	Secondly, social responsibility and helping communities is becoming a very hot topic in the corporate world. This phenominon has extended its effect to outside of the corporate world to invlove the rest of the society. Therefore, many people are becoming more aware of the importance of being socially responsible, hence, they are starting to convey the benefits of being socially responsible to younger people (i.e. their kids, students, dependents... etc.).
	Finally, many young people groups are being used as great examples of time dedication in helping communities. Not only their communities, but also international communities. For example, a group of kids from France have gathered their toys and other belongings and sent them to Lebanon to help the kids who have left their homes because of the current Israeli-Lebanese war.
