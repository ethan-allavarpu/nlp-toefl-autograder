Unfortunately I have to agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not invest enough time to help their communities. In my opinion a possible reason for this development might be the lack of a strong incentive for the young people to spend their precious free time on helping the community instead of maybe hanging out with their friends, playing video games etc.As especially cities grow to become more and more anonymous, young people do not see the reward of their work in the community as they would in a smaller one where everyone knows each other and the youth would get more appreciation for their voluntary work. This is, of course, a misconception, because volunteering for a good cause is appreciated in both environments,it  just may be not as obviously to the young people. So the question is: What do the youth do with the time that they once spend on helping their communities?
They spend it on activities that they simply find more pleasurable.In fact, this is a trend that we can detect in all layers of society and in all ages, we do not need to search for this phenomenon among young people only.Of course,it is more fun going to the cinema than helping elderly members of the community. So what we need is incentives. We could get incentives from the parents,helping their kids realize at a young age that it is important to take responsibility and help out in the community at least every once in a while,depending on the child. Small activities done for the community may be more important and more valued than one might think and every kind of work is strongly welcomed and appreciated.
The community itself must have a strong core in order to create networks and to attract the young people through for example specific institutions and activities only for the young. I say this,because I believe that only if the zoung people can identify themselves with their community,at least to a certain extent, will they be willing to become an active member and help by investing a bit of the work as well.
