i will agree with the stament. to be succesful you have to extend your studies. learn new things, that is there only way you can be succesfull and continue to be succesful. An example ,companies  that makes electronic advices, like games station and  ipods.They takes risks every year to bring new improvement and new ideas to their menchadises. Well sometimes it can be dissapointing with the result, like people not  liking it then the effort goes down the drain. but sometimes is  can be the opposite.With electronic most of the parts are succesful,they always bring new adjustment to the society. like  there new cellphones that are going on now, you can find camera on it, mp3 players on it, internet and the list goes on. another example will be cameras. there is improvement when it come to cameras. you can now have digical camera  that take good pictures and it gives you the mode to take pictures, like if you are indoor a mode to use for  indoor pictures. it has voice records and video tape records. All these shows there risks and action they takes to try different and new things. i believe that the more they try news development or ideas, there more succefull they will be, this goes for now and  hopefuly for the future.
