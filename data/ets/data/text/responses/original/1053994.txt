Not just because I am a lawyer I can neither agree nor disagree to this statement because it is far to general. 
A person who does not enjoy life as a young person will most likely also not enjoy life when he becomes older just because he has just never "learned" to enjoy life. 
Even if you look a the question as a comparison of people at one defined time one can't evaluate which group of people enjoys life more than the other because it just depends on to many factor and  age itself is rather an unimportant one of these. 
Much more important are factors like, health, relativ wealth, and environment. However I believe the most important factor is personal attitude.
Personal attitude is so important it can even outweight many or even all factors. Anybody would agree to this in general however very few try to benifit from this fact. 
E.g. somebody who is healthy, rich and lives in a peradise among many friends but will is unhappy would look for a reason and maybe just come up with the fact that he is relatively old.
The other example would be a young, poor, sick, and lonely person. This person could still be happy and enjoy life and would not even think about the question why he would do that. 
 Whether you are young or old does not indicate anything about whether or not you enjoy life.
I personally think that my life has improved a lot since I have grown up. I think I will never fight my age but work on myself to improve myself and my attitude and to enjoy the things that are really important in my life which are my two sons and my wife. If my family and I stay healthy than what else do I need?
