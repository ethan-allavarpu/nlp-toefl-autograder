The older generation sometimes says that the younger generation does not play an active role in helping their communities anymore. They think that the younger generation is selfish and only wants to earn a lot of money. There are a few points supporting this opinion but there are also a few against it.
The first thing to say is that the traditional bonds between the younger and older generation have dissolved nearly completely. E.g. it is not common anymore that both generations live together in one house. Therefore the younger generation can not feel this strong sense of community that once existed. From this on I think that the younger generation is involved in several other activitites to help their communities. First, there are a lot of teenagers who help the church or the local administration, e.g. during elections. I have some friends doing that and I can say that the work they do there is really admirable. Second, there are many teenagers who are involved fighting against environmental problems. These activities are really beneficial to the local community because they help to achive a sustainable lifestyle. The last point is that many students are working hard for school or university. That does not only mean that they want to achive professional success but they also want to improve life at school or university for theirselves and for all other students. 
Now let me talk about a point I've just mentioned: the hard work for school or university. Of course this means that they have to spend a lot of time learning and not directly helping their community. But I think that learning is the best way to achive a good life for the whole community. The young generation knows that without working hard they won't be able to achive a good life for their community, e.g. if there are no skilled workers in town economy and finally the whole community will suffer a lot.
Finally you could say that it's not true that young people today do not spend enough time to help their community. As we've seen, young people engage in a lot of activities in order to help their community but they do this differently than the generations before.
