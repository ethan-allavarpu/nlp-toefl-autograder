I disagree with this statement. There are some disadvantages for having a trip in a group I think.
First it is quite difficult for in a group to decide the best destination everyone feels satisfied with .Second
during a trip in a group, we cannot have a trip in the way we each like. I think such a trip is far from  enjoyment and relax. We need to think well about the true purpose of trip.Travering definitely is not getting stress. In a group we cannot help but feel certain stress. It is better for us not to have a trip if it applies to us.On the other hand ,having a trip by myself I think I can make my trip meaningful, free from stress and of course fun.There are some reasons for this . First I can go to the destination which I think  I want to visit.Second,I do not have to care about other people.In such a situation I can enjoy seeing sights for much time which I thought would like to more .That is why I think the best way yo enjyo a trip is to do it by myself.
