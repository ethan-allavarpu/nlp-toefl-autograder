	I don't agree that human beings will have a fewer cars in use than we have them today. There are two reasons that I think so.

	One of the reasons is that more and more our popurations are increasing in it's number because of the explosion of the population all over the world. This is to say, our popuraton is 6.0 billion right now , and it will increase up to 6.5 in twenty years or more than less. Therefore the car usage paesantage will increase in it's number.
	Other reasons is that our social attitude toward young people have changed. Comparing the past with now, the latter is much more leveral to young people. As long as 50 years ago, In many countries, the cars are driven by men, not woman but nowadays a lot of women drive a car because of the social change from conservative to leveral. The age that people are able to get the driver licence is difference country to country, and in certain country, young people who are 16 years old are able to get the driver licence With the social change, some of our countries might have such a law.

	With the reasons, I don't agree that, buteven though we have more cars in our future,  the fuel will totally change, from oil to electricity or something like that.
