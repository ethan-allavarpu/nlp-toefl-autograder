Technological advancements leading to a more rapid pace of life has indeed brought about a revolutoinary change in young people nowadays.

	Secondly, people are much more competitive nowadays. There is competiton in each and every field today. It is the time where only the fittest of people survive. Everyone wants to build a good career so that they can provide for their family as well as to ensure a bright and prosperous future. In this rat race, they are left with no time to think about those outside their family. Hence, they choose to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities towards their communities.
	Lastly, they are not aware of their responsibilities and duties as individuals towards others. It is sad that few choose of them to remain so still. There is a need for awakening the youth so they become more aware.
	There are few young people who have still managed to contribute largely to their community.
