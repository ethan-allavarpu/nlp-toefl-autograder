Learning facts is undeniably a necessity for all students of all ages. That is even the fist thing that a child is asked when he enters school. He learns rules, such as standing straight and in line before entering a class, or not walking around while the teacher is giving a lesson. Those rules are transferred to him before the notion of good and bad, he understands the consequence of his ations earlier than the reasons for their necessity, and acts consequenty. In our school systems, learning prevails upon assimilating, at least at the beginning.
The expectations necessarily evolve with the age of the students. In higher grades, it becomes almost impossible to learn by heart without understanding. Assimilating a concept is likely to develop the cleverness of a student while learning will only fil his memory. As school is supposed to learn children how to think, learning becomes of lesser importance from a certain age. 
Yet, learning is still necessary for exams, for proving one's ability to memorize combined with one's intelligence. Also, as it is the only mean by hich one can assess a student motivation at work and ability to memorize, learning can not be neglected as a key factor in a student's success and in a whole school system. 
For a student's personal development, understanding concepts and ideas is obviously more important and almost necessary, but it doesn't supress the learning part, which is much more easily assessed on a copy for example.
This raises the question of the role of school. Indeed, if it is only supposed to insert people in their future professions, the ability to learn fast and a lot prevails innevitably. But school is also supposed to be the fundametal pillar of a nation, as it strutures people's mind and is therefore essential in a democracy for example.
