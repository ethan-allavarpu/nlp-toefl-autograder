I agree with the statement that the young people nowaday do not give enough time to helping their communities. They spend too much time in studing their class, waste much of their time in personal enjoyment, and do not understand the real meaning of helping their communities. 

As a fact, the parents in Taiwan always want their children to have good academic achievement more than the other things. They want their young people to study again and again, and do not expect them to pay any attention and spend much time to the other things except reading and studing. As a result, the young people will not spend much time to the other things such as helping their communities.

The young people are still like children, so they prefer to play such as spend their time to play computer games or watch TV in an air-conditioned room in their vacation or off-school time rather than to help their communities outside the door, espcially in a hot summer weather in Taiwan.

For example, my nephew is a teenager, but he did not know any things about the communities where he lived for more than ten years. He prefer to talk to his friends by cellar phone, and have a date with his girl fiend. He spend his time to help his communities only when his high school ask him to hand out the report about his service in his community and the report will be graded. Except this. when I suggested that he may have a community service in our communities, he was surprised that I have such a strange idea that he never have.

In conclusion, it becomes a common social phenomenon that the young people do not give enough time to help their communities because their parents and the whole community did not facilitate them to help their communities and give a good reward and help them to understand the real meaning of helping their communities.  As such, the young people are loosing their recognition of their own communities.
