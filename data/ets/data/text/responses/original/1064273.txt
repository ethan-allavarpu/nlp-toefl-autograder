The way we are educated is influencing a lot what we become later. I think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important. It can be very usefull when one wants to interact with other people. It is essential to share ideas and thougths with others. In the professional life, for instance, if somebody in a company has to work with another department, his task will be much easier if he knows a little bit about the activity of this department. Even if it is not a complete understanding, it will be appreciated by the other part.
To give another exemple, related to personal life this time, it is very agreable to be able to argue or discuss when we meet someone new. Without this broad knowledge, how wolud we make contact, at least at the beginning? We would obviously miss the oportunity to get in touch with peolpe. I would say that, having a broad knowledge is really a plus in life, it is like the promise to be welcomed and integrated almost wherever we go.
On the other hand, I think we cannot only be satisfied with a broad knowledge. We need to go further sometimes. We need to be in something exciting to keep a goal to our life. And this cannot be achieved without being specialized in one subject. Again, professionaly speaking, it is essential to be specialized. Nobody can pretend to a job, which is something specific of course, if one does not know enough on this particular topic. That is why we usually start our studies by general education, a broad knowledge, and then, gradualy focus, year after year, on what we want to do. 
Plus, I think it is something very valuable for a human being to go in depth of something, to prove to ourselves that we are able to do something special, something that defines us.
To conclude, I would say that both approaches are necessary. We need both to learn things about our environment, about the world, in order to interact, but we need to survive, by saying, "I can bring you this, I can be helpfull with this".
