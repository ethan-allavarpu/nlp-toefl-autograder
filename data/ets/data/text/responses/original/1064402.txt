Older people usually consider young people of our generation as more lazy and more self-centered than young people of their own generation. Eventhough the origin of this belief is easy to understand in individualistic countries, I find it difficult to accept the idea that people nowadays  don't give enought time to helping their communities.

 Indeed, I think that modern societies offer more structures and organisations to allow people to help the community indirectly. For instance, systems such as the social security system in France allow workers to help indirectly the people needing health care by paying taxes. If this idea do not seem to apply directly to young people, once again we can argue that young people are indirectly helping their communities. For instance, when they spend time working for school in order to get the needed skills to eventually find a job and contribute to the wealth of the country.

   Some people would argue on the other hand that governements of modern societies do not offer enought to the people who still need individual help, not only in term of money, but mostly in term of time. An example could be the lack of volontiers for the care of retiered people needing personnal help. If one approach consists in blaming the people having free time, like the young people, for their selfishness,and alternative attitute can be to look at who helps, and who doesn't help to change the situation.  Modern societies probably reached this point of no-return where people got used to rely on the governement for social issues. Therefore its seem reasonnable to give more credits to the people who actually act on the governement - by the power of voting, by protesting, or taking part in the political life - so that social issues become a major concern. 

     As a conclusion, they are different way of helping a comminity, and we can find, depending on the culture  or the country, specific groups of young people who actually give time to make something usefull, either by  working hard at school, or by voting.
