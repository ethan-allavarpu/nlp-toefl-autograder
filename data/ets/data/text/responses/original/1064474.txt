In my opinion, I do not agree the statement, for I believe there are three major point that can help to increase the number of car: new resources, growing populations, and new technolgies. These elements will continue to push up demamds for cars.
     First, we are now developong new energy resources substitute fossil fuels; for example, solar energy and hydrogen energy. These energies have two fascinating points; they are safe to environment without producing any chemical substances causing pollution problems. And, they are obtaind almost infinitely. By refining these new technoligies can be applied in twenty years and we can use car without harming our planet. That can be a strong element for the favor of cars.
    Second, the convenient systems in cars are enhancing its ability. For example, today we can reach destinations without losing our ways thanks to the navigation system supported by satelite communication. Moreover, the safety of the car is improving; the physical strength of the car body is becoming incredibly strong these days saving many drivers lives. These new supporting systems or technologies provide more confort to the car users, which means the consumption for the cars will keep strong in future.
    Third, the rapid growth of population in the world is going on for at least twenty years. This means there will be growing demand for the cars continously. Although we are also tryng to create new type of trains such as renior motored car that is moved by magnetic power, I think people tend to buy cars that can provide safe energy and fabulous convenience. Actually, I experienced the subway newly constructed was not so used by citizens in New Delhi, India.  
     As stated above, there are three aspects supporting the stromg demands for cars: the development and applications of new resources, new technologies and systems gives drives more relaxing atmosphere, and the exposion of number of people who need cars in the world. In twenty years, it is quite sure.
