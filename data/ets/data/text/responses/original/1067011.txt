Some people prefer to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Others believe that elders enjoy life more. when faced with the decison of who enjoys more, quite a few would claim that young people have more energy to enjoy life more and that is my point. there are numerous reasons why young people enjoy life more. I will explore a few of the most important ones here.
The main reason for my opinion is that young people are at the begining of the life and they have more advantages. Take my father and my brother as example, my father has a lot of responsibility while my brother doesn't have any. when my father want to do something new, he should think himself and his family. my brother, in contrast, goes out at night and comes back whenever he wants and he isn't bread earner. 
There is another factor that deserves some mention here. People are different. They have different traits, customs, belief and life style. some pfrefer to stay at home when they get older, others go out more than they did when they are young.
Similirly these reason also apply for young people. when we consider that some young people have a lot of responsibility, while other don't.  young people have opportunity to choose what they want. when they have opportunity, they can go for it and they can make the most of it. 
it seems very difficult for us to prefer one to another because some people are very emotional others very strict and small problems don't usually get to them.
in short, even tough young people have some problems choosing their career, they have more advantages to enjoy life. but that doesn't means older people don't have fun. they do. sometimes more than young people.
