Very few people in France think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic than to specialise in one specifice subject. Indead, they think that you need to go through all the details of a specific field if you want to be efficient. Is that true or not ? 

I don't agree with such a prejudice. On the contrary, I think the more you know, the more efficient you are. For example, if someone wants to work in a library, will he be more efficient if he knows everything about books, publishing and printing ? I don't think so. I think he will be more efficient  if he knows about different things such as history, anthropology, philosophy, litterature or science. Practice can give you all technical knowledge but it will never replace broad knowledge provided by schools and universities. 

The second reason why I think a broad knowledge is important in our society is that people who have broad knowledge are more flexible. They are able to switch from one field to another. In other words, they are what I would call 'complete persons'. The can adapt themselves to every change.  For example, you can be a banker today and become a manager tomorrow. 

My last point is about my political vision of a modern society : I think that a good citizen needs to have a broad knowledge of all academic subjects in order to make good choices. Reality is complex : if you want to understand what is happening in your contry and in the whole world you need to have a solid knowledge in different fields such as geography, economy or technology.

To conclude about this subject, I would say that the british ideal of the 'gentleman'  who knows about all aspects of human things continues to be important in our modern world.
