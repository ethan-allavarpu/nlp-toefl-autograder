 Since cars were invented the number of them circulating has been growing and growing along with the improvment of technology. For this reason, I do not see why in twenty years there could be fewer cars than there are today. However, one could say that cars might be replaced by other very high tech means of transportation, but I think twenty years would not be enough to do so. 
  In my opinion, which is also a wish, in twenty years there will be more cars or as much as today, but maybe they will not pollute the enivronment as they do today. In fact, a lot has been already done to reduce pollution and I am sure there is still much that can be done. For example, Italian cities and other European cities are making Europeans buy Euro4 and Euro5 cars, which pollute way less than standard cars. This reduction has been possible thanks to improvements of cars technology. Every month around the world there are show rooms that present new kind of cars, less and less polluting, more and more sofisticated in shapes, motors and accessories. Some of these new kind of cars are very expensive, depending also on the brand, while some are cheaper. Industries are doing a lot for making people buy these cars, from rich people to less fortunate people. Not only industries and the most famous brands companies are acting in favour of less pollution. In fact, governments are doing a lot as well. For instance, they organize many information campaigns; they define calendars of days during which people must not use cars in the cities where pollution is over the maximum level permitted and they finance electric pubblic transportation.
  I think these are good reasons to retain that cars will not decrease in number for the next twenty years; on the contrary it is common to expect them to be numerous but less polluting than they are today.
