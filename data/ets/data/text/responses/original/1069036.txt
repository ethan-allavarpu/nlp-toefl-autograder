Being committet to your community can have various forms. It starts from helping your family in its daily chores, taking care of the neighbours` house while they are away or spending some time in charities organisation. At the core of all the above is the recognition that we are not just individual, but part of a community. There is also the sense of gratitude for one's gifts in life, such as youth, health or any skills, and the sense of enrichment that comes from sharing those gifts and making them useful to others.
	Overall I agree with the idea that young people do not seem focused enough on the needs of their communities, and I actually think that they are fairly detached from the concept of community altogehter. I think this is a very complex phenomenon and linked to a great number of reasons. 
	First of all, it seems that our society and culture put a high value on time, especially spare time. Partly because modern life is very demanding, partly because the offer of entertainment and outdoor stimulations is so varied, we praise our time as a supreme luxury and feel very frustrated when we cannot use it in complete frredom. 
 	Secondly, I think Western societies have developed more and more in a hedonistic direction. In other words, we feel it is our own right to enjoy ourselves, feel free in our choices and simply follow instant gratification. I think this is particularly apparent in young people, as they claim they right to play and have fun, and resent any request of help or support as a form of injustice.
	In a dominant culture of self-absorption and pleasure, taking the time to communicate with people that are different, for background and frame of mind, seems unjustified and this leads to another worrying trend. It seems to me that there is a general detachment between young people and older generations or people in need. These are generally the people that need more time and support within the community, and it would be the duty of the younger generation to look after them.
	In conclusion, I think that values that have become more and more present in our societies are now central in young people's vision of life. As a consequence, there seems to be a more selfish conception of one's use of time and gifts, that unfortunately leads to the neglect of parts of teh community that might be in need.
