If i was asked wheather I prefer try new things or dont try,I would prefer try new things for three reasons.

First,to try new things may have a lot of hard experiences and a lot of risks.
I think to change ever own thinking is too difficult.
If my age would have been more higher,it would be more and more difficult.
But I will be able to get more highly advantage.
To get more highly advantage,For example I can change more high saralley work and get more bigger house.

Second,to try new things will be able to connect many new networks. For example,work, friend ,own lifestyle and so on.
To get more intelligent friends may be bright own life.
And if I had  very difficult problems on my life,they would have a good advice for me.
For example,work,relationship for friends and so on.

Third,to try new things may get more excensitive mind.
To try more difficult ploblem will be able to  change more strongly own heart .
To get more strongly heart will be able to communicate for many kinds of people,I think.

So,I think to try new things is more better than not to try.
I think to serrect many things, is to good for my final life
