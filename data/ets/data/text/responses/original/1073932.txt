We often hear people saying that young people should enjoy life as long as they still can. Therefore, it is sort of commonly accepted that older people are not enjoying their lives, or at least less than the younger people. We will discuss both sides of this statement, and will express our final point of view as a conclusion.
	

	Young people have less responsibilities than older ones: older people are responsible of younger ones! As an example, it is rare to see parents buying firecrackers to make a joke to their neighbour whereas it is cliche for youngsters to do so. Young people don't have to work as to make their family live; they attend classes and have a lot of activities; they are young and they enjoy themselves, because they simply have less responsibilities. But this is a youngsters point of view. Do older people really enjoy their life less than younger people?

	Obviously not. For example, having a family and giving birth to an offspring is enjoyable, perhaps the most enjoyable thing in the world! If older people enjoyed their lives less than younger ones, our world would be a very sad world... Thus, some young people do not enjoy there life, and some old people obviously do. The statement can't be true because of this simple fact. Honestly, if older people didn't enjoy themselves as much as younger ones, would it be worth to live this? Obviously if life is not enjoyable, then life loses its primary purpose, and living this life would be purposeless.

	I think the statement is a young people point of view, and is not really well thought. At first, we feel it is true, but in fact it is because what we think is enjoyable or not changes when we get older! Loving to read poetry at the age of 13 is rare, but at the age of 65 it can be fully appreciated and understood, because the person has more experience and can catch the sense of it. I think that how we enjoy ourselves is different, but no one enjoys him or herself more than someone, based on his age. Enjoying life is universal, and has no age. Young people enjoy life as much as older people do, and vice-versa.
