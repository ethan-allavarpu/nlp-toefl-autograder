In my opinion, this is a very strong statement and I cannot totally agree with it in the way in which it is currently phrased. 
As a first general point, I think that similar statements can never hold absolutely true or false, so before discussing the merit of my opinion, I would like to narrow down the reach of the statement by specifying a particular geographical or cultural setting that we are referring to when talking about young people and their communities. I will therefore take my home country as a reference. 
Communities face constant changes as society as a whole change, and most of these changes result into challenges and demands imposed over individuals of all ages. In particular, the beginning of the 21st century has seen a macroconomy revolution in terms of the labour market - in particular highly specialised and trained labour - and information technology resources. Extensive outsourcing of certain services to Asian countries and moving big parts of the manufacturing industries to the Far East caused many young people to be unemployed in Europe, and in my home country too, as a result. Where once communities used to be wealthy and secure employment could guarantee social welfare and enough free time for everyone to spend with their families or in social activities, now the younger generations face difficulties in earning enough to mantain thei usual standards of living. I agree that they spend less time helping out their communities , and Therefore, it is understandable that they will have to dedicate a lot of time to job hunting or even engage into a second and a third occupation, and will have no time or energy to spend on helping the community they live in. Well organised activities such as participation into charities work, or more spontaneous and 'private' ones such as caring for an elderly member of the family or a disabled neighbour will eventually have to be put aside by those young who face economic difficulties, and will only be pursued by the luckiest individuals who do not have to worry about earning enough to feed themselves and their children.
