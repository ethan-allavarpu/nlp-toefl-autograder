The speaker hits truth when he says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Commercials were originally a mode of informing consumers about the availability of a product. But over the years, the sheer innocence of an old banner proclaiming the opening of a new KFC restaurant in the neighbourhood has been lost in the relentless wrath of commercialisation. 

Today, a commercial informing the viewers of what the product actually is would not even be noticed, much less lure prospective buyers to a hopeful brand. In the deadlock of efficient brands we find ourselves in today, advertisements need to be one step ahead of each other, a phenomenon previously seen only amongst the firms employing them. And this very much involves enhancing the features of the product they endorse. 

The world of advertising revolves around competition offered by others, and that has brought it to such a stage where enhancing a product is a common practice. Probably the most appropriate example would be that of a recent advertisement my eyes fell on a few days back. It promised of a "mansion draped in greenery", but the actual house was ironically different. It was a modest two bedroomed flat, hardly something you could refer to as a mansion. But sometimes advertisements cross the limits of what would still be classified as acceptable. Perhaps the most blatant of these are the ones employed by the automobile industry. In a recent controversy, one automobile dealer in New Delhi was fined and barred from operating for a year because he had promised a prospective buyer a sedan, which turned out be be a mess of pure lies and thievery. 

Although sheer malpractice is evident in this "enhancement" of products, some people still advocate the validity of these advertisements. A recent survey in the United States of America brought to light a staggering number of people who see nothing wrong in this new trend. It only goes to show one thing; that we have learnt to live with it and although unwanted, it has become an integral part of advertising today. So much so, that all you need to do to be sure of it is look into the local newspaper. Even though it might not tickle our fancy, if statistics are anything to go by, this practice is here to stay.
