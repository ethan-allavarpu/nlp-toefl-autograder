for me in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today, I agree.
First of all the car is very important for a lot of people because the men need go to the work or at home or in generally we mast go for the city bat also out city whit freedom.
I think that today also if we can choose what use for tryp, the car is the first time that make, because is the free and we can go whwre want.
Secondly I hope that the situation will be beter because the our city are very inquineted and we can't go free for the city street because there are a lot of cars, for me the city mast have steet true for  to drive and we learn to drinve whit sureship and whit respect for ader cars without to go fast.
In conclusion we mast use the car only when is necessary e when we can't use ather solutions, becose sometime we forget when is all easy, but in the future we can't return in the pass, therfore now we mast look for the better world where to live.
the tecnology mast only help to live well, I hope that is very difficoult.
