Can we say that successful people are the ones willing to try risky possibilities rather than running business as usual? I  would think so. There are, indeed, diffrent ways to "try new things": launching a product that creates a new demand almost from scratch, and adding small changes to the way a business is run as successful people would not necessarily have to make a "revolution" and bringing slight changes can sometimes be a challenging risk.
First, let's consider meaningful changes. When taking a close look at the business world around us, there is no denial that many company leaders have succeeded in creating very profitable products that have sometimes meant the start of a new story for their company. That's what happenend with Apple when Steve Jobs decided to lauch the iPOD. Instead of merely sticking to the core business of the company, which is selling MAC computers, this leader decided to take the risk and start a totally new product. And, indeed, he succeded, reaching a point at which his product triggered a new way of listening to the music, therefore changing some cultural habbits in the American society, then worldwide and creating a new demand for his specific product.
That has also been the approach of Starbucks, that changed the way people drink their coffee: not any more in a caf, but walking in the street! There was a huge risk for this success story at the begining, as it involved changing people's habbits and way of life, but the risk was definitely worth it given the success of the company. 
Secondly, we delve into detail in a different approach: the small changes to a business model-but that can mean more, indeed when put into practice. It can also be a significant risk to change slight things in appearance, but a very rewarding one. For example, Dell created a new way to make computers with customarized computers ordered piece by piece by the customers. That was very successful
