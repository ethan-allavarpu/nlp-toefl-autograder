I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. I belive that a lack of altruistic and selfless acts are directly spurred from economic and social reasons. 
	In today's world, many youths do not see a valid social reason to immerse themselves in community service. Although the majority of the world's population lives in abject poverty, those who are capable of giving to their communities are often segregated from those who are in need. Hence, the lack of awareness prevents today's youth from helping out. 
	Speaking from personal experience, I find that there is a gradual decline in my own community of youths that refuse to give or help out their communities in any manner. As the president of Key Club, an international community service organization in my high school, I find it more and more difficult every year to recruit new members to replace the ones that have departed. I remember when there were about 40 members in the group - now I find that it is even difficult to gather 20 members for the meetings. The only sense of giving that can be felt in my school's atmosphere is purely caused from the need to "look good" on transcripts for college. Of course, I'm sure not all of them feel this way, but I truly think it's safe to say that the majority feels this way.
	Every year, monetary donations rise in Key Club as the number of members decline. This is an economic reason why I belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. Inevitably, most of us in the world have been brought up be capitalists - when we give, we expect something back in return. However, when youths help out with their communities, they do not receive something tangible as rewards. Hence, today's youth neglects to help their communities. Due to this fact, those who can help and give find it extremely annoying to invest their time in helping others. Thus, their only token of help is through monetary means, which they believe is compensation for not giving time to their communities. Nonetheless, society's greed can even prevent the giving of money. 
	It's truly a shame to look around and see that today's youth, or tomorrow's leaders, refuse to invest their time when they are perfectly capable of doing so. It is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their times for others. Once youths overcome their laziness, fear of helping out, and learn that the greatest reward (as cliched as it may sound) is the fuzzy feeling they get from giving time and helping others, it will be the massive stepping stone in getting the world's youth more involved.
