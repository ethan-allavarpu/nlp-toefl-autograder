Young people definitely contain the advantage of a fresh thought and innovative independent spirit, differently from the elderly that has often experienced much of the world's phenomenological offerings and seems to approach situations with more tranquility and serenity. However, this proneness of both groups of people to behave in a certain manner does not determine the exact outcome of the indiviual development of personality, which is a key factor that truly determines how effectively a person chooses to enjoy the beauties of his or her existence. Hence, when we speak of a vast majority one should definitely considerate the fact that younglings are more open to challenge and extasis than senior citizens who seek a calm state of being, which to the eyes of society is less likely to express the true enjoyment of life.
   Young people have the strenght and availabity to discover new grounds; it is part of our nature that whenever we discover and explore, sentiments of joy fill our souls. That is what young people take advantage of, this is, their physical condition and psychological standpoint that drives them to seek gratifying experiences more often than elders do, and finally accomplishing such goal.
  My grandfather used to play soccer when he was young and that was his favorite sport. He received so much joy and gratification from this activity that he would never miss a game. Now, he is 70 years old and all he wants to do is rest. He used to tell me: "Soccer is it son, once it's gone, you only live from your memories". Now I am a soccer player and this sport has become part of who I am, like a blueprint. My life would not be the same if I do not play, due to the fact that I find so much joy and happiness in it.
   Thus, I believe young people do enjoy life in a more complete manner, not to be unjust or parcial, but because it goes beyond what is palpable, it is a cycle, the cycle of life. Just like a flower reaches its most beautiful point and opens up in all its splendor and after a certain time dries up and dies, similarly is a man who lives and finishes his race. Even though older people might find joy in different tasks, their cycle alrady allowed them to reach a certain climax that was once considered as true enjoyment, therefore leading the way for those behind them to discover and get to search for the same type of gratification, making the levels of joy definitely higher at a young age.
