There is a common belief that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are people who do not believe that advertisements do not say the truth but the opponents of the subject do not think so. I also agree that advertisements make the products seem better that they really are. Here are three main aspects why advertiements may lie.
	First to think about advertisements is their purpose of preparation. Advertisements are designed to convince the consumer to buy or consume that particular product. In order to convince a consumer for a product, one should make him believe that he really needs that particular product or make him believe that the product is best at all. For both of the purposes, the product has to be shown to be the best. This brings us the possibility that advertisements may reflect non-real facts about a prodct.
	Secondly advertisements are prepared to increase the profit for the specific product. The producers, who would like to profit more and more, would also agree to display a non-realistic advertisement in order to make the product seem better so that increase the sales. When the sales increase, the profit also increases. In short if the product seems better, its sales increase and this leads to a higher profit for the company.  
	Finally, the third purpose of an advertisement is to help the company to dominate in the market. Companies have to compete with each other with respect to their products in order to survive in the market. So an advertisement that shows a specific product better that that of another company would make that specific company to win the race among the companies. This again shows that advertisements are not designed to describe a product but rahter make it seem better.
	In short, people believe that advertisements make the products seem better thatn they really are, are right to think so. Because advertisments are prepared in the thought of financial profits. A company would not agree to say the truth in the cost of earning less.
