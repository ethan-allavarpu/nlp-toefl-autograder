There are many reasons why the number of cars in use today will not stop increasing in the future. Just judging from the way cars have become more and more popular and common over the past tweny years it is unlikely to expect a sudden change in that area.

Another point supporting that theory certainly is that cars have become more affordable for everyone and also very easy accessable for young people. Most people in The United States of America posess their first own car bz the age of sixteen.

Another problem that in my opinion is directly linked to the number of cars and that we are facing today is the problem of obesety in sociey. In most developped countries peolpe are getting bigger and bigger, become more and more lazy and therefore more likely to drive a car. Simplz because it is more convenient.

Then again, people are also starting to be aware of the direct link between cars and the effect they have on environmental changes. Some strongly object to the idea of having a car because they simply can not live withe the thought of destroying the planet out of egoistic purposes.

In a television transmission that i happened to watch a few days ago i also heard a discussion about tha earth running out of natural sources such as oil. If there is no more oil we will have a huge problem supplying our cars. Although that is not expected to happen anytime soon scientists are trying to find alternative by developping more natural and environment friendly ways to make an engine work.
But I believe that this will take a huge amount of time and not be presented to the public in the next years. So, no, i do not believe that there will be less cars in 20 years
