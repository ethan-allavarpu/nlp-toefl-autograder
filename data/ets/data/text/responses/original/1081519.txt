The issue statement states that there will be a decline in the number of cars in the next twenty years. I strongly disagree with this statetement .Moreover i think that the number of cars being  used is going to increase in the near future.
                                First reason i would like to give is that the cost of cars is going to decrease gradually. If you obsereve the past trend previously it used to be a luxury to possess a car. But now it has become a necessity. Also the cost of cars  when compared to the past rates is very low now. Hoping that the the same trend continues in some 5 or 6 years even the common man will be able to afford a car. So everybody will be rushing to own a car and hence the number will rise exponentially.
                                Second thing is that cars are thought to be more safer when compared to other two wheelers. This feeling is gradually spreading in countries like india where the two wheelers dominate the roads. if this notion becomes stronger present two wheeler owners will replace them with cars and again the number of cars will increase.
                                Third idea is that cars can transport many people at a time when campared to bikes and scooters. so these bike or scooter owners  also will be trying to purchase cars. Also as the prices of petroleum products are going to increase people will think of spending money on cars and have combined transportation rather than investing on individual tranportation means such as two-wheelers.
                                  Last but not the least many people thik that owning a car is a kind of prestige issue. In this modern world where people are constantly trying to show off it wont be a surprise if more number of cars are purchased. Hence in the near future more number of cars are going to land on the roads throughout the world
