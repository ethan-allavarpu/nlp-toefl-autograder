Comparing to previous generations, many of today's young people have forgotten the importance of their community. Instead, they are now focusing on their own leisure times, such as playing video games and watching television. 
        It is a fact that many young people do not give enough time to helping their communitires. Since today's development of technology, many things seem fascinating to people. Especially to the young people, who are curious about the society. There are too many things that young people want to experience and try, and it also includes many negative things, such as smoking and drinkging. Unlike today's people, our previous generations learn to treasure their communities because they felt responsible to their own environment; it is something they were told when they were young.
       Unfortunately, today's values are different from before; people concentrate on physical enjoyment. But, while they are experiencing the sensation of enjoyment, they are also ignoring their obligations to their communities and society. In schools, we all have learned to be responsible to our surroundings; however, many of us have forgotten the real concept of this responsibility. 
        Further, there are many examples of helping communities. For an example, maintaing the cleaness and order of community is everyone's obligation because everyone is a part of the community. But, the many young people do not realize the importance of this obligation. When the elders ask them for some working, they are usually respond with bad or unpleased attitudes; they think it is a waste of time to help the community.  By looking closely, I see many negative things that will happen as those young people become adults. Our society will be decadent if the government is ruled by lazy people; more scarily, it is not only a joke but a truth of today's young men. 
       However, our society have already realized the importance of correcting the young people's attitudes. They first begin the work at school by requiring community service for each student before they graduate from schools.  This is an important step to start with, because school is the place where everyone goes to. Besides the effect of community service, many schools now also spreading the idea of protecting our environment. Personally, I see these two things are start to work in many young minds. 
       Finally, before we act anything, we should first notice that Earth is our home; we are all the owner of this planet; therefore, while we are enjoying our physical happiness, we should also do something for our community. The community is not only our home but also belong to our offsprings. Even a bit of work we contribute to the community can make a change in society. Lastly, we should provide a clean and healthy environment for our children.
