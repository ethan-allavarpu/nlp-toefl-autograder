Travelling is always an enjoyable, sometimes tedious, leisure acitivity. Nowadays, with travelling being such a normal thing to do, one is confronted with the choice of choosing between travelling with a group and, or by yourself.
So, can the one choice be better than the other?
First of all, most of the time,  travelling with a group tends to be relatively cheap and with the tour guide usually being a local, allows the tourists to receive additional information during the trip.
Also, since the tour guide is doing this for his living, preferably as a professional career, it is ensured that the quality and quantity of the information given during the trip will be better than a tour organised by one's self.
Secondly, a point that is often missed is the socialising factor. While travelling with a group, it is impossible for one not to get to know anyone. It is not a given though, that one's fellow cohorts is as gregarious as one's self.
Lastly,  efficiency is the key, meaning so much as: Seeing a lot with little time. This allows the traveller to see as much as possible in a limited time. On the other hand, efficiency, such as many other things, is a double-sided sword. Being as efficient as possible prevents the tourist from savouring his moment during his travel, such as Mt. RUSHmore for example.
On the other hand, travelling without a group releases the tourist from the shackles of time. One can enjoy every moment of the tour, go back to an exhilirating sight, or just relax for a day -freedom is the key element here. 
Informing one's self is of the essence when travelling without a tour guide though, since nothing can be worse than a tourist without an idea what he is doing. This doesn't mean that one may not opt for a private tour guide though. 
Of course, all of this comes with a price. 
With this one can conclude if one wants a truly informative and economically feasible trip one should opt to travel with group. Yet if one wants to truly appreciate the true enjoyment of travelling, savouring every moment of one's trip, then one should opt for the other.
