I mainly agree with the statement that people enjoy life more when they are young than when they get older. But some details need to be analysed to proove this idea.

The first point is related to brithday anniversaries. It is common that children and teenagers are often very happy when they get one year older. This is often related to presents, parties, and lots of friends wishing a happy birthday. But old people, are very often sad and ashamed of getting older, and they anniversary remind them of those feelings.

The way people enjoy life depends on their age. It is different if we consider children, or teenagers, or adults.

Children seem to be happy very often. They can enjoy any little trick during hours and keep smiling and laughing without any relevant reason. Children do not have to worry about important things, indeed, they even do not know about them thanks to their parents that try to keep them apart of any troubles. 

The way of enjoying life changes as the children become teenagers. The main reason of teenagers enjoying life is freedom. Even this often goes along with little fights with their parents, teenagers have the will to create their freedom by prooving that they can be independant. As they feel free, teenagers have new hobbies, sometimes forbidden, but they enjoy the risks they take.

In opposition with the happyness of children and teenagers, adults cannot enjoy life as easily. Being an adults means having reponsabilities. Adults have to work to earn money and have lots of bonds which keep them out or entertaining and enjoying life. Moreover, when adults have children, they manage to offer their children the happiest life they can. So they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own happyness to the benefit of their family. But even if that is difficult, parents enjoy every little moment of happyness they can share with their children.
