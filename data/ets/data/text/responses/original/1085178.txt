I agree with the statement that people who achieved success do try new approaches, rather than sticking to the older things which  are familiar to them.
      For example ancient people were in the impression that earth is a flat surface.Scientist who proved the theory of universe didnot stick to these preformed concepts but rather thought innovatively and achieved success.So new ways and ideas are always essential for the success of a person.They allow us to increase the horizons of our knowledge and perception of facts.
     Techonological advances are demanding people to acquire new skills and approaches.Only those people who adapt to these circumstances will flourish in present day compettitive world.To illustrate,suppose a person is well skilled to type on his type machine and is complacent with his skill with no interest in learning computer skills will not meet new expectations of the employer and might loose his job.Moreover,a person who adapts to the new demands and learn computer skills will flourish in his career.
A successful person has the habbit of exploring newways and new things and he tries to put himself in a superior position through his hardwork which is also innovative.If a person sticks to the methods well known to him and refuges to acquire newer skills donot get increments and promotions in his job.
        Some people do not dare to risk new changes in their work.But we can never discover anything new without experimenting.So,people should try newthings to improve themselves but that move should be genuine.For example,a wealthy bussiness man who invests all of his wealth in shares might experience a severe loss amd may become a pauper.So I feel that new approches should be definitely encouraged but the person should judge his move rather than hastily implementing his idea.If the person is reasonable in his approach,risks due to new approaches get minimised and he enjoys the fruits of his innovation.So it is not always risky to take up a newthing.Rather we cannot acjieve any thing in our life without facing that minimum amount of risk.
