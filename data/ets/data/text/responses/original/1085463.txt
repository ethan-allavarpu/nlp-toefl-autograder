I disagree with the given statement becuase I strongly believe that society has managed to reach the hieghts that it has today through specialization and division of labour.
Specialization is a theory that emphasizes the importance of concentration in one particular field. When this theory was employed by factories and manufacturing plants, it resulted in a dramatic increase in production. Ofcourse specialization has its drawbacks and faults which are caused due to lack of knowledge in other fields, but the benefit of knowing one thing really well, greatly outweighs the faults of specialization. 
A reason why specialization is so successful is because eventually (usually after 12 years or so of schooling), people realize that they are better at somethings than other things, or they realize that they have a passion for a certain field and that that's what they want to do for the rest of their lives. At this point in time it becomes apparent to them that other knowledge, that doesn't further their understanding of their subject choice, is a waste of time. After all, if some one wishes to be a mechanical engineer, why does he need to know the literary feature that Shakespeare had used to capture his audiences attention. 
I've already decided what I want to do in life, and to tell the truth studying things like Spanish and Business seem to divert time away from my goals of becoming a research scientist. I love reading about the latest medical breakthroughs and discoveries, but all I get by learning Spanish is frustration and low marks. I sincerely doubt the importance of spanish in the long run, I mean sure it might help me communicate with people who only know spanish, but how many people will I meet like that. Through my personal experiences I've learned the importance of knowledge in all areas, but I've also seen the importance of specialization, and in my opinion, to know one thing very well is a lot better than knowing relatively nothing in everything,
