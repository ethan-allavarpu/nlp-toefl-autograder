I do not believe that the given statement is true. Indeed, I understand the logic which lies under that assumption but personally, I don't have the impression that it is a veracity.

First of all, it is important to analyse why someone who only meets success is more likely to take risks than somebody else. As a matter of fact, when you succeed a project, you feel satisfied. The more you achieve what you want, the more you become confident. Then, it is like a spiral : the more you get, the more you want to get. In fact, when you plan to start a business and it works well, you think about expanding your activities. If it works and you are already at the head of a big company, you may diversify your business. That is why big companies like Bouygues are in building, mobile phones and so on. Virgin makes discs but also develops its own mobile phones programs. Those companies take risks, while entering new markets. They believe in their success because they are supported by their customers. 

However, new things are not always done by successful people. Creativity, for instance, has nothing to do with sucess ; it is about personality. So an artists does not always meet success. Nonetheless, his or her desire to create will still go on. That explains why a lot of painters did a lot of breakthroughs after many failures. Another example is Alain Baraton, a famous gardner in Versailles. He has failed during his school years but then, while he worked in Versailles he developed a passion for gardening and created new arrangements around the castle. Besides, you cannot be successful all the time but it does not means that you are less willing to do new things. In addition to that, someone, who really wants to be recognised by the society and has never achieved that goal, will probably try everything he or she can. 

As a conclusion, success is not so closely tied to 'boldness' as the statement suggests.
