Over the last century, advertising has become one of the most developped and i;portant activity in humankind. It suurounds us everywhere today: on television of course, in the street, in the subway, on our cars... we can not avoid it. Some may say that: "Most advertisers make products seem much better than they really are". Do they? Is advertising that simple? Do they not take into account the risk it creates when the customer will be disappointed?

      First of all, the question seems simple, of course they do, they sure will not make their products seem worse. They are paid to sell something to people who did not even want to buy it in the first place, who did not even needed it sometimes. They must create a need in customers' minds and a will to buy precisely that product. How could they do that without making their products look good, even better than they are, to kind of sell dream to people. It is not what they do it for but in the end they kind of give hope to people, like when one sees an advertisment who would make one believe that the product it defends is exactly what one has hoped to find during all these years, or tht it is so much better that all its competition. That is why in all soap spots, the laundry is whiter and smoother than ever or in all shampoo spots, the actress' hair shines more than ever.

      However, is it always like that? Do not advertisers fear people to stop buying a product because they were deceived by the difference with the ad? Actually, even if it is not to be more honest with people, some advertisers use other techniques to sell their products. They can choose to criticize their competition in order to make their product look better by comparison. It is what is importat in the end that the buyer choosse your product over the others. It was used by Coca Cola in a spot in which a little girl shows her deceivement with thw voice of a Godfather when she is given a Pepsi Cola and not the Coca Cola she ordered. Advertising could also use reversed psychology, maybe to play with people curiosity, like the campaign using do not go and see that movie, it is bad for instance.

     To conclude, I would say that whereas other techniques exist, most advertisers make products seem better than they really are. Nowadays, eventhough people know all they see in advertising is not true, they fall for it anyway and that is how tha consumption society got this far.
