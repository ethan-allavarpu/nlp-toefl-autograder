In our childhood, we try to omit other's behavior and handle new things. We learn how to stand up properly. Sometimes we would fail and cry, but soon we would try again until we succeed. Then, we soon try another new things and get more and more ablility. To me, I believe learning new ablility is a life-long proccess for successful people. We should take risks to try new things in order to succeed because it provides us opportunities to benefit of life, improvement and correction.
	Trying new things benefit people's life because people could gain many usable skills that would be useful in the future. For instance, Bill Gates gathered the valuable knowledge of computing in his early life. He then used this knowledge to establish a unique computing system - Windows. The new ablity allows BIll Gates to be richest man in the world in his later life. Trying new things always let people to gain wealthy. Thus, the people would always pursue in studies even after they have been working for a long time. 
	When people try new things, they would get improvement that they could not get from doing things already familar.

In contrast, if I read a new book about "How to Straigten Your Personality," I may alter my old way of doing things. I could improve my way of 
	Last but not least, people could make correction while they try the new things. The reason for that is, people can make comparision. The new things would let people to rethink the way they do old things. They thought they do things pretty well, but actually they did not do it right. Therefore, successful people always try the new things in order to correct the mistake that they did not realize before.
	In order to be successful, people should always not hestitate to try new things. They can therefore enhance their life both intensively and extensively.
