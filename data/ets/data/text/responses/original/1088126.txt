Although I understand why some people think it is more important for students to learn facts, I think that it's more efficient for them to understand ideas and concepts. To my view, there are three reasons why ideas and concepts prevail. First, ideas and concepts enable a student to understand not only one fact but also plenty other facts because facts happen once and ideas can explain many facts. For example, you can know how to cook a specific cake but if you understand how cakes are made in general you will be able to cook every cake. It means that by understanding a fact, a student would be able to anticipate only this precise fact next time he experiences it. Instead, if a student understands the concept he will be able to anticipate the outcome of many related facts.
Secondly, ideas and concept are the first things that you learn at school and I think it is efficient. For instance, in mathematics, you always begin by learning the rules before applying them. Moreover, theory is something that gather information from the experience of other people. That is exactlwhat the teacher is teaching: concentrated experience rather than a fact.
Last, according to my personnal experience I think it's more important to understand first ideas and concepts. I created a fashion company but I knew only a few things about this industry. Thanks to my knwloedge that I have learned in class I was able to adapt and anticipate things as I already knew this industry. For example, marketing concepts can be used for every industries. By using them I was able to cleat the hurdle which was my ignorance of the industry.
To conclude, I think that ideas and concepts prevail on facts and that is why. Still, as I said at the beginning, I understand people who think the opposite because you need to fact to understand how to apply the theory.
