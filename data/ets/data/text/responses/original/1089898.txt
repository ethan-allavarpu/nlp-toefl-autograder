I agree with this statement that says that it is more importanto for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
	One might agree with that statement because on many situations it had happened to me that I had to learn all the facts for a test and I end up learning them all, but at the end of the test is like if everything wipped out of my head and that happens exactly the same with all of my classmates. But when we learn the concept of the fact instead of the fact it stays with you forever. Many times when I am in a conversation talking about history or chemistry I star talking about concepts that I have learned in a period of time and explaining my knowledge that I have obtained by me understanding the concepts.
	This are the reasons for which I agree with this statement. Knowing the facts can work for a day or maybe a week, but the concepts stay with you forever.
