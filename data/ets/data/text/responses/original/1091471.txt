Well, i opine in consense with the statement given.Yes, i actually prefer to be assisted by a tour guide when i am travelling as a group. The reasons that support my argument are disclosed as under!.
 	Firstly it would be of great advantage to be accompanied by a guide because it proves to be beneficial to be directed in a place which a group is not well acquainted with.It is better to be guided in a place which is new to us because it prevents the group of tourists being split up in case of any misshappening!.Therefore the group is led in a unison preventing the chaos of losing some members. Hence it saves a lot of time to concentrate on the purpose oftravel. 		             Secondly employing a guide provides us the detail of  all the important places to be visited.Therefore it provides us with a good review of all the important places without missing any.This  again saves us  time in searching out for places to be visited!.
             Third pont of advantage of employing a guide is that of the awareness of the places visited. A guide really provides us with very valuable information as of how, why ,when and other related questions of the places visited. Therefore it is of great advantage as the knowledge regarding the places is complete.
            Another advantage is that of the communication with the people of that habitat!. This is really very important because the right way of communication with the local people might be really very difficult in most of the cases. This might mislead a group in knowing certain things for example the whereabouts or a route to a monument for that matter. Therefore if a guide is accompanying us we need not really face the communication problems as he translates the dialect of the local people and speaks out that is really understood by us.
 	Another important advantage is that a guide might really help us to sort out our accomodation at an economical place in case we are paying more for the stay than we are actually meant to pay. This again proves us an economic advantage of employing a guide!.
             Therefore from the reasons which i have disclosed i really favour employing a guide although it is a bit expensive.
