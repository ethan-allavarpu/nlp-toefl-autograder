I strongly agree because I believe that if you manage to understand the main idea of an event, it will last in your mind and you will be able to remember it for a long time, and that if you just learn the facts of the events they won't last in your mind that much.
An example that I believe can be given is when high schools students learn about hystorical events, if they just memorize dates, names and places they will be able to remember them just in order  to aply them in a test, unless it's a super important subject of history.
But if they analize the situation, analize the events that ocurred and comprehend why did that event ocurred in the first place, they will like the subject more, they will feel a little bit smartter and the dates, the names and the places will be left in a second place, so this will even help them when they will have to memorize dates and such, because they will be able to associate the purposes and reasons of the events with the numbers and the names.
I believe that is not necessary for learning to be boring, if you just memorize everything and study just because you want to get a good grade, you are not doing the real purpose of learning, you're just dealing with a lot of problems and getting yourself tired and bored.
Studying can be fun, if you understand everything you will feel smart, if you just learn the facts without actually understanding what they mean you will feel bad and less intelligent, so I think that teachers should encourage students to exceed themselves and to develop their intelligence and not to memorize a thousand books without understanding anything or withouth even learning things that will truly be helpful in your life.
People that are truly smart can solve a problem without the necessity of consulting someone else who's supossed to be more intelligent, and if you need to read something a thousand times to actually get ahold of the idea you're just a mere puppet and is pointless to live as a puppet because at the end of your life you will feel bad for having restricted your true intelligence.
