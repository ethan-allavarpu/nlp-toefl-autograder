I think that its much better for a person to have a specialized knowledge of a specific subject than having a broad knowledge of many academics . Because being specialized in one subjuct gets you to know more about it and to be able to discuss it easily and thoroughly without any problems , unlike having a broad knowledge of many academics because having broad knowledge leaves you on the suface of eveything not being able to dive in any subject . For example if you where in a conversation session or on a debate about something , having broad knowege would let you be able to talk for alittle bit with everbody using the thin layer of knowledge you have to discuss stuff with people, but if you are specified in one subject you may be able to get into a deep intresting conversation .
 	Also being specialized in one subject gives you better working opportinities than the opportunities given to broad knowledged people . Because these days institutions want specialized people that can handle complicatied isses in buisness and life , people that can be put in hard situations wich they can handle easily without panic and to problems, and talking about money wise these institutions pay alot more money for those specefied people . 
	Another thing is that when we talk about the career issue specialized people are always remembered and respected everywhere they go and thier names will not ever be forgeted , broad knowleged people they are not well known or at least the majority of them . For example when we try to say who is the best in chemestry of all time we have a name , or when we try to remember who is the best in maths we have names .
	That does not mean that people who have broad knowlege are bad or have less experience but i think that specialized people leave thier memories on the minds of others or they leave thier finger print on the book of history.
