If your goo what you already know your not successful you are just precise. Their are a bunch of people that are good in what they already know but one makes successful people outstand is their ability to do things that they do not know.	
	Successful people try new things and take risks because this is what makes them successful persons. If your good at something and you keep doing what you know you are not opening your horizons, you just stay in your comfort zone. To be successful is to take risk, to be something more than ordinary. Successful people try new things because if not they would not be successful persons they would be precise. To be precise is not a bad thing because you are good at what your doing, that is part of being a successful person, but it does not make you a successful person because you can not do more ore simply do not know more, and that is why being precise is not being a successful person.
	I agrre that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. People who are successful are good at everything the aim to be good at
