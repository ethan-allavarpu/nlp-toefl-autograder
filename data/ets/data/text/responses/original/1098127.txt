An anecient Arabic says "take whole things from a particular thing, and take something from all things." Having a broad knowledge of many acadimic subject is better than stay on one speclizie subject for many reasons that strict scinces, provied another scinctist and expand personal awareing.

	First, sinces are complacated and crossed. By way of example, there is a crossed between Law and Political, so any specilist who interest in Law needs to study a little about political. And there are many scinces which concrated from many scinecs, such as, Piochimestry, Economy law, 

	Furthermore, specilist needs to know some information about board scinces to biuld bridges with another specilist, he and another people need each other to provide thier knowlodge, experinces, resaerches. For example, pofessor of Physics will get a lot of benifit from professor of Math, that will encourge thier ideas and theoris, so 

	Moreover, a broad knowlodge expand awareing of mind, it gives a lot of information that can not be in a similar labs which specilist stay in. As example, professor of Law can not know any things about periods of arabic poets if he does net deal with Arabic Letrituer professor. Also he can enjoy in peoples inventions, and he gets more angles view to life.

As a result, I agree to having broad knowledge because it has a lot of advanteges, change realtionship between scinctist, and expand awaing.
