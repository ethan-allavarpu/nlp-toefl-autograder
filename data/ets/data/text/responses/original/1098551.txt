The life change more confortable and easy to live, and also the price of car decrease. The people prefer to buy and use their own car then to use bus or subway. 
So, some people can think the car will be more and more in the future, but  I disagree that "In the twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ".

First of all, the peple will rethink the pollution, so they will decrease to use the their car. As you know that the car is reson of the pollution, and people use the more and more then pollution also getting worse and worse, because of carbon dioxide which is from the car, and other bad gas. So people will decrese to use the car. 

Secondry, when all people use the car, this things will make trafic jam problems, so people always live in the road, and they can not do what they want to do on time. So they will prefer other trafic such as bus and subway, because those go faster than the car.

Thirdly, it will be obvious anyway the people always die even the medical is developing. And the future there are too many people that do not get married and have the baby, so there is just few increasing people.  Hence it is not different from the now.

Hence, people will not use more the car  in the future than rutine.  because people always think their enviroment than their confortable. And also they do not want to late all their appointment.  As someone said that "Time is the money."
