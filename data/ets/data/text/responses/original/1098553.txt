The statement asserts that understanding ideas and concepts is more important learning facts.

Before we move on to judge the merit of the assertion lets try to differentiate between "Ideas and concepts" and "facts".

Ideas and concepts represent the fundamental "line of thought" or "logical progression" behind any phenomenon. For example different cultures use kinship nomenclatures e.g. Uncle, father, mother etc. in order to express not just natural relationship, but also social relationship, status, power equation, economic situation etc.

On the other hand, "Facts" represent the "hard examples" or "expressions" which can be immediately placed in their context and are self explanatory. For example, Uncle is term used for father's or mother's brother. But in many cultures uncle is also a term used for any significantly older male, even if no biological relationship exists.

What it essentially means is that it is very difficult to understand "ideas and concepts" as separated from "facts", and vice versa. The two are interlinked in many ways.

Its only thorugh "observation" of similarities between facts that ideas and concepts  emerge. That is if it is observed that in a culture all providers of food and security and termed as "Father/Mother", it means there is more to nomenclature than the biological relationship. Its no conincidence that Hitler was termed "Fuherer" i.e. father.

On the other hand, once an idea or concept has been "obserevd" and "established" through the study of "facts", it provides a medium for understanding of all future factual observations. That is whether they support or oppose the idea or concepts.

Hence, observation of "facts" is both the "initiator" and "distiller" of concepts.

In this light, it will be fool hardy to see ideas and concepts as opposed to facts. Both of them are equally important for real learning. Students need to understand a "concept" through assimilation of facts. Concurrently a concept or idea provides the medium for assimilation of large number of facts. Both are inseparable for complete learning.
