When a product is developed, there must be a way to introduce it to the public, and once it's on the market, a way to increase its popularity and therefore its sales.

This is where advertisement comes in, to make the most sales and profits out of any kind of product, of any quality, and of any actual functionability, and I strongly emphasize "of any quality, and of any actual functionability" since most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are.

I believe it has happened to all of us that we see a commercial on T.V. about a product that interests us, mainly because the function it will perform helps us in some way, or makes us more comfortable and happy, but when the product is purchased, it stands far from what we thought it would be or it would do. Many people try to look at this as a scam has been portrayed against them, but the truth is that advertisement was mainly doing its job, which is attrack potential buyers.

The advertisement's purpose is to make you believe that this product is the best in quality, the best in price, and the best in its performance, in other words, its the best of the bests in its kind. 

In order for marketing professionals to reach this goal they must study the behavior of the public this product is being intended for, its interests, its likes and dislikes, and even its dreams and routines, so that the product can be addressed in the most proper way and in the most proper time, presenting it as something that the potential buyer could never live without.

The truth is, that some products do live up to its advertisements and to the buyers expectations, but those are surely not the majority; and in the rest of the cases I believe we just have to look out, and pay very close attention to the real message that its being sent when this advertisements are played and displayed anywhere thay are, because even if the marketing proffesional understands what my desires are and whay my behavior might be in front of a certain situation, he or she can not dictate what I will actually do, only I am in control of myself.
