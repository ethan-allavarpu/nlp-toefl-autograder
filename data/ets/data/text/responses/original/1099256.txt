Yes I Agree that most advertisement make products better than they really are.  Allready advertisement to focus to buy and consumer products. way of  reaching their purpose is makin to admire consumer. So products must be attractive and services to  other sense of consumer.  Deemands must creative by advertisement. 

The advertisement is one of them marketing tools. It isn't given direct message by advertisement they are general, imagination, colourful and  attractive. It musn't be border. Advertisements are serviced 6 sense of human to creative demands. 
For example orenge juise advertisements, All ages of people  could be a product. Messages might be power, enegy, sex, dream, healty, even as like medicine. Even pictures of nice real oranges and more colourfull but its integreds sugar, water, fruit parfums, glikos, fruit nectar etc.. May be they will be enjoyable atmosfer in back ground of the advertsiement  for example a young people party. That could be message sex, romance etc...

So succesefull advertisement will be determined by rate of cunsomer. So how much sperate of people, earns profits, addvalue are important points of making advertisement that Products are seem better than they really are.
