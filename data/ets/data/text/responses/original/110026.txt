The field of mechanical engineering has improved in several ways which is being reflected in the new generation cars. It is cliche that once we get accustomed to a comfortable way of living then it is rather is very tough to get rid of it. 'Comfort' and 'luxury' are like traps, once we get caught we could hardly make way out of it. So thus, I disagree with this argument that cars would face a declivne in their usage.

Cars have been  the major modes of transportation in the world since a long time. People utilize cars for a variety of reasons such as- It gives an enjoyable,thrilling and comfrtable ride, Some people are fanciful about it, It could be utilized  at emergency times when public transport is unavailable, in order to avoid crowds in the public transportation, to expose their financial status too. 
 
Cars too have their negative aspects such as increasing air pollution, accidents etc. But these are avoidable and alterable  aspects. Pollution could be avoided by utilizing unleaded and well rectified petrol. And people need to be more prudent to avoid accidents.  So thus we could ward offf with the two major negative aspects.

The past ten years  has seen immense enhancement in the field of car manufacturing. New cars with more additional features are beiong produced, which attract the people to it. So all of a sudden the usage of cars can never cease and there will not be any declination in their number.

I would say that there would be no felicitious reason for the car utilization to drop. Atleast the manufacturerss would never let this happen. This field might show more improvementr rather than declination. Technology is showing tremendous improvement in all ways. So definitely, car utilization will not decline.

So i conclude by saying that as long as human race exists the Existence of cars too will continue because we humans are after all materialistic and thus the craze for cars will continue.
