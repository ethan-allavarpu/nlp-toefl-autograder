 The advertisement announces are invading the space of city, the radio, the TV etc. Fot this reasons some people can't stand them, furthermore other people consider them as a type of "art".
 Those are simply personal opinions, but, the real problem is when the advertisements don't say the truth. It's a great problem like all  lies.   
  Some people think that isn't a problem and thay say that the person has a skill to decide a product indipendently on basis the only functionals of the product. 
 But I disegree this opinion because often the advertisement don't speak about the only functionals of the product but it promises other characteristics that don't depend by it.  
  In conclusion the advertisements must be controlled and  they must speak about the product only with its real characteristics.
