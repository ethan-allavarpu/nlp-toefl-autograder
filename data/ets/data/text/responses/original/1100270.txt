As a young person myself, I often feel guilty for spending so little time with the community.  I had often noticed that the social bonds between neighbors have diminished in recent years, and people are becoming less caring than before. That's why I think we should definitely spend more time helping our communities.

But how?  The main reason nowadays that young people doesn't spend much time with their communities is that they are crammed with homework, extracurricular activities, entertainment,...etc.  They are simply not spending a lot of time strolling about the neighborhood.  Without any interactions with their neighbors, young people will easily neglect their role as a member of their community.  Although they read about community service in their textbooks, few actually participate in it.  And when you ask them why, they simply reply: 'I don't have time.'

So if we wish to solve this problem, the first thing to do is to decrease the amount of burden on young people.  Schools should end earlier so that young people can spend more time inside the community.  Teachers should give their students less work on weekends so they could have adequate time to conduct effective community service.  Parents should relieve their child of to much activity and they should not force them to go to cramschools.  Without these corrections to our education system, schools would end up to actually teach young people not to spend time with the community.

Of course, one might contend that young people will end up spending the extra time playing computers and not doing community service at all.  That might be the case for some kids, but in my opinion, if people felt they are involved in their community, they would try their best to make it better.  This sentiment can be further enhanced by government propaganda and social education.

It is everyone's responsibillity to bring young people back to community service.  They should not simply put their blame on laziness manifested by the younger generation.  I pray for a day when the old bonds between neighbors can be re-established.
