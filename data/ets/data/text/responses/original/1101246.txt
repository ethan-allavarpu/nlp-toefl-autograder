So far as the question is concerned, I am not quite at home with the statement  that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Although it may be argued that the young population is not interested with social and political affairs as it was in 1960s., I believe that young people have willingness to help the communties in which they live. 
It is a well-known fact that the young population is aware of the communal issues as they are parts of a family which belongs to the community. In other words, the more they live in family the more they give enough time for their communities. For instance, in a village or in a minority group, the young population do not hesitate to participate in the charity programs such as visiting the hospitals, helping the oldest members of the community. They even became a member of NGOs in order to demand or to help for the communal interests. 
On the other hand, we may acknowledge that there are some current problems to keep the youth intact with their community as well as with their families. The process of globalisation suscitates a global village where individuals gain universal attributes and goals rather than interesting with their communities. Therefore, it becomes difficult to keep the interest of the internet-based youth appropriate with that of the communities. However, this situation can not abandon the young willigness to help their communities.
Consequently, we may consider that young people prefer interesting in private and global objectives rather than communal or social ones. Yet, we should not ignore that they are also active in especially helping their communities and they find time to helping even if they feel themselves busy and overloaded by the educational or professionnal life. Briefly, young people nowadays give time to helping their communities in spite of the difficulties in their globalised and internet-based lives.
