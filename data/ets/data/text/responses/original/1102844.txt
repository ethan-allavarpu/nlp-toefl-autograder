I disagree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to helping out their communities. On the contrary, their levels of awareness about the plight of people around the world has increased from yesteryears and a growing number of youngsters  are lending a helping hand to the society.

Today people are making a mark for themselves at  very early stages of their lives. Young movie stars, musicians, sportspersons and the likes of them are winning the hearts of millions around them.In the process they are making millions. But one can proudly say that a considerable proportion of their funds is directed towards charity.The "Bill and Melinda Gates' " foundation was set up a long time back when Bill Gates was in his prime.The amount of work that has been put in by the then young couple is commendable when it comes to talking about AIDS and cancer relief. Although a middle aged couple now,their work goes on.

If we dont talk about the celebrities and concentrate our attention on the school kids, we find that community service has started coming more naturally to them.There is a sense of pride attached with reaching out to the less previliged.Children consider themselves to be heroes of sorts if they do a good deed and help out people.The fact that schools and colleges have taken a positive step by according due importance to social work while considering admissions is an added impetus. It prompts youngsters to do their bit. Even if done out of personal interest, it exposes one to the joy of "reaching out" and prods them to do more.

One can cite numerous examples of engineers and doctors who have graduated from ivy league colleges and can easily make big bucks.But statistics show that an ever increasing number of these graduates are turning their backs to high paying jobs in favor of settling down in small villages and towns.All this because they feel a sense of attachment and duty towards their homeland and truly believe in alleviating the troubles of their nations.

Thus, the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities is unqualified and underrates the contribution of youngsters towards building a better society.
