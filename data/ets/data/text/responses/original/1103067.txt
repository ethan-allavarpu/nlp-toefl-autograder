     It is debatable whether young people do not help their communities not spending enough time. Some people say that young people provide enough time to helping their communities in that they are doing some voluntary works for communities. However, I agrees with the statement in that young people tend to spend more time studying and they don't have the sense of belonging to their communities. 
     To begin with, nowadays students do not help their communities enough time. This is because they think that their grades are more important than helping communities. Therefore they are spending more time studying for their good grades than doing volunteer works. For example, my brother is a high school student. When he were asked to work for his community from his school, he got angry.  That's because he think helping his community is a waste of time and also doesn't help improve his grade. 
     In addition, because young people don't have  the sense of beloning to their local communities, they are not willing to help their community a lot of time. Young people think they can move other places whenever they want to move. Therefore they do not feel the necessarity to provide aid to their local communities, sacrifying their own time. For instance, according to KBS, Korea national broadcast station, 70% of young people they do not have to help their local society. When they were asked reasons, they answered that they did not have the sense of belonging to their communities.
     In conclusion, enough time for young people to helping local communities do not meet needs of communites. This is because young people invest their time on studying for good grades. Also they do not feel the sense of the belonging to their communities. This phenomenon must not be underestimated in the aspect that young people will be a person who leads the local communities.
