Young people and older people are both vague terms which will be hard to make an discussion. Young people could vary by the perspective you have of young people. There for to make the argument clear, I will assume that young people are people in their teens, and older people being fifty years old and above. 
	In oder to establish the argument of whether young people enjoy life more than odler people, first of all I would like to compare the advantages and disadvantages of both young and old. One advantage of an young person is the life time they have left which leaves them more options for the future. On the otherhand older people have death coming faster than those of young, therefore have limited choices they can do. There is the difference of potential between young and old. Although it is arguable that old have the same potential as young, there is more time for young in order to develop their potential. 
	Another advantage for young people if the physical ability. Although there are exception, young people tend to be more physically fit than those of old. Also young people also have the physical potential which they can built up, whereas it is harder for older people to develop physical strength. 
	Older people definately do hold an advantage which younger ones don't. From the experience and knowledge they have accumulated from the past years, they are able to understand and take appropriate actions where as young ones are unexperienced which may cause difficulties in life. 
	A point that younger people experience great disadvantage is the restrictions set by law on certain people under age. An example will be alcohol, driving and other entertainment that youth are prohibited. Older people have the right to reach all of that is possible whereas youth are not. 
	Whether old people or young people enjoy life is completely up to the individuals. Both have advantages and disadvantages. If I was to make an opinion it will be that young people enjoy life more, because I only have view or taste of what it is to be young. Also people have always been chasing a way to stay alive and young for a longer period of time. This idea supports my idea the young people enjoy life more.
