In a way, I disagree with the statement that Young people nowadays do not devote enough time in helping their community. I beleive that in the current times, communities themselves do not require much help or much time in help. 
In the past, people of a small town or a village identified themselves as a community and worked towards mutual and communal benefit.
There were weekly meetings and the problems of the community were discussed. Young people who form the most energetic part of the group volunteered in solving the problems and in arranging festivals and local gatherings.
People were more physically involved the community. They worked as a team and one's problem was everybody's problem. It was natural for young people to be the most active component of the community.

In many modernised parts of the world, the situation is in stark contrast to what it was in the past. The revolutions in communication technology and the advent of the internet has largely devated people from each other to the computer.
Systems and services have become more efficient and computerized.There is much less need for people , not only young to be involved in any help mainly because there is not much help required. People can discuss problems in e-communities and via email and chat.
The town administration has it's public website and any problem can be posted on it. Responsible people can then take necessary action.
so today, there is not much help required but there is a big need for ideas and in this case young people still form the most active group. 

So in view of the current times, I disagree.
