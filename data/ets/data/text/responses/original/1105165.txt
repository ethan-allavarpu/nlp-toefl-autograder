In modern capitalist society, advertisements are a natural part of life. In this situation, I believe that it is all but inevitable that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

The fundamental reason is that modern consumerism has made it necessary for companies to advertise their products simply because there are more goods than are necessary.  Before the advent of mass production and mass consumption, the situation was vice versa: there were probably fewer goods than are necessary.  Naturally, therefore, producers did not need to advertise at all.  But in today's society, because of the tremendous advance of technology, it is possible to churn out unnecessary commodities produced mainly, or perhaps only, to gain profits by selling them.  As a result, producers are forced to make their products look much better than they really are so that they will be able to sell them out.

Another significant reason why advertisers exaggrate the value of their products is people's expectation to have newer and "better" things.  In order to keep up with these consumers' demand, companies are compelled not only to make new, slightly-upgraded products all the time but also to make the small improvement as impressive.  The case in point is the computer industry.  PC makers change their models three or four times a year even though the improvement is minor.  Because people expect this and because all the other competitors do so, a PC maker cannot afford to continue to sell a PC first put on the market a year ago.  As a result, it is necessary for PC makers to make their products look signficantly better than their previous models by, for example, changing their looks although the content is not much different.

In conclustion, I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for two reasons.  Modern consumerism has made it necessary, and as a result, people are accustomed to have "better" products, which forces producers to exaggerate minor improvements.  It would be impossible to change this situation, and, therefore, consumers need to be wise enough not to be deceived by advertisements.
