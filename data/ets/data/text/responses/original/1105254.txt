	In my opinion, young people actually enjoy life more than older people do. I hold this opinion because young people are less weak, less afraid, and less fragile than older people tend to be.

	First of all, the majority of young people have alot of energy they can disperse without becoming tired easily. While most aged people get tired after just one activity, young people, like students, can do many activities in just one day. Even after long hours of work in school, they can easily take part in an afterschool activity, and then come home to do homework and chores. On the other hand, older people get tired quickly even after one activity, such as cleaning the house. Being able to do many activities in one day promotes the sense of accomplishment and happiness, and thus young people who have more energy enjoy life more than older people.

	In addition, young people tend to be more brave than older people, and take more risks. Risks, because no outcome can be predicted, add excitement to the lives of young people. However, most older people prefer being stable and assured, and do not take risks. For example, alot of young people will travel to distant countries, and gain more experience. However older people prefer remaining where they are. Thus in the lives of older people things are monotonuous and predictable, whereas in the lives of young people, nothing can be predicted and everything is exciting.

	Furthermore, young people are also more mentally capable than older people. As people grow old, they lose their ability to concentrate for long periods of time, or to learn new things. In contrast, young people are full of potential and can learn new things, like another language or a new recipe. Learning new things is very enjoyable, and younger people who have the advantage of better mental capabilities, enjoy life more than older people.

	Older people are restrained by various factors, such as fragility and inability to continue activities for long period of time. However, because young people are stronger physically, mentally, and also have less fear, their lives are filled with excitement and fun, enabling them to enjoy life more than older people do.
