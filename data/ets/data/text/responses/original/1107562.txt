I agree with the statement.The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

People travel in order to enjoy  and take a break from our routines.Some people travel for pleasure purpose But the main reason for travelling is to see new places and meet new people.We can not meet new people unless we do not travel in  group and as far as seing new places is concerned,we can not know the history of the places without having sumone told it to us.A person who has all the knowledge about the past present and the future of a monument,city or a country.This knowledge is best given to a traveller by  tour guide.

Travelling alone does not serve the purpose of travellin itself.We go to new places and want to explore them but we are unable to because we are new to the place and do not know where to go and what to do.A tour guide leeds us to the right places and the tells us things we would never know if it wasnt told to us.Specialy historical monuments.There is a reason behind every historical structure ever made and visiting the structure and not knowing when ,why and by who was it made is like seeing the pictures in a book and saying we have read it.Only a tour guide has the knowledge and the communication skills to make the people more familiar to a new place.

We have heard about the saying 'the more the merrier',this is the right way to describe a trip taken in a group.When there are others traveling with us we not only get to know them and make new friends but they also add to the whole experience of travelling by sharings their backgrounds,cultures and experiences.The kind of excitement it adds to your trip is worth it.What do people get by tarevlling alone?Not even half the experiences of the  people who travel in a group led by a tour guide.Because they haven't met new people,made new friends,gathered knowledge about the place they have visited.

For a person like me who loves to talk and make friends and learn from my experience of travelling to new places with new people there cannot be a better option for travel other than travelling in a group led by a tour guide.
