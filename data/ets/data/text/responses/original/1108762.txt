I totally agree that in the next twenty years or so there will be much fewer cars in use than there are today. Although it may not be evident in the present scenario with car sales gong up each year but many factors like pollution, space crunch and increase of public awareness will see the more and more people relying on public transportation as their sole means for travelling.

With the price of gasoline skyrocketing beyond general public's purchasing capability, people are slowly realizing that their cars are becoming more of a liability to them. It is highly unlikely that the fuel prices will ever decrease given the limited resources of fossil fuels.
Cars based on unconventional sources of energy like fuel cells,solar power etc are yet to establish their financial viabilty. All these factors suggest that people will look upto public transportation as a permanent solution to their woes.Besides being lighter on purse the statistics suggest that it is much more safer mode of transportation than cars.

Also exploding population in metropolitan cities is leading to major space crunch on roads and parking lots. People are fed up of wasting hours in traffic jams and parking queues. They are realizing that if most of them use public transportation , it would benefit all in terms of driving space and time. Non polluting vehicles like cycles are once again gaining popularity among masses for various resons, health being a prominient one . Infact many people in China go to their offices daily on bicycles.  

Therefore, it seems that the idea of the "Ford", the famous car manufacturer, to ensure car for all may not came true. With government strongly promoting the benefits of public transportation and increasing awareness among public reagarding the disadvantages of owning and driving a car we will see a sad but necessary demise of the era of cars.
