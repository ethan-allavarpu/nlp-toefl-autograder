Travelling in a group led by a tour guide presents many advantages.
First, you can share and exchange your opinion and feelings on sites you visit with the groupmates. It is often very enjoyable and refreshing to listen to other people' feedbacks.
Second, the tour guide takes you only to locations that matter the most or that are the most representative of the country visited. Therefore you avoid waste of time deciding where to go and whether the designated location worthes the visit. The guide is often a great source of important information about the visited site. He can turn the visit in a very interactive way, something you couldn't get from a book.
Finally, the tour and the guide make the travel much more enjoyable as everything is already planned. There is no need then to bother with organization details and unexpected events. Everything is handled by the guide and the tour company.

However, travelling in a group and a tour guide may also have some disadvantages.
In my eyes, being in a group means that you no longer master your time. Unless being selfish and imposing your ideas to others, you cannot do what you want. You got to stay within the bounds and respect other peoples' wishes. And listening to someone whining the whole day because the schedule does not please him is indeed extremely annoying.
Besides this, a tour means everything is already planned. There is therefore no room for sudden change of schedule or unexpected location to visit. The exitement might be undermined.
If the tour company provides poor services or the guide lacks knowledge about the location, then your experience may turn out to be very disappointing and frustrating.
Another very bad habbit of touring companies and guides is the fact that they often take you to locations, restaurants, museums with which they have a partnership, a deal, so you are invited to purchase items in those locations and not others. Personally I dislikes very much those practices as I have the feeling to be a kind of toy in their hands.

My best advice is to choose carefully the tour company. To rely on other people's feedback, friends in order to determine which tour company suits the best our wishes and needs. About the group, my suggestion is to welcome things as they come and all the time to focus on what pleases you the most and to sweep away any little annoying detail.
