Yes i do agree with the statement Most adverstisement make product seem much better than they really are because without having advertisement how can we know about the product. For example take product like oats which is used as food item we can have with hot water and mixing milk and sugar, it can be shown as a TV add by playing a role by reputated person like sports , film actor and like model. play must be for 30 secs only in that we must show all types things like what oats contains and how it is usefull for daily used people by prefoming and add with in 30 sec showing the embalem of the product. The advertisement should be shown globally to people . 

                     Giving advertisement for a product it gives complete picture or use of the product which should be seen by people. Product should have import and export value by their demand.
The product should gain the demand by showing proper advertisements. People should have proper idea on the product they should believe it by seeing proper advertisement. Means advertisement should impress the demanders. Advertisements should be shown globally , there we can find the demand.


Advertisements should have proper theam which impress consumer and they should attract by seeing that,There are many ways to sell the product by giving attractive gifts on using advertisements,  showing that if product is buyed you can have gift coupons of worth of x/ Rs. The whole advertisement should take abcitvate and should gain more demand. 

Advertisements plays an major role to sell a product. because product should show in real and caption shown below with small letter that indicates these play is performed by experts so please u do not follow the same, Means it  incdicates true but not real.

One good examples is that cigar sellings are shown on TV advertisements but on packets it will retuen SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH. The best example for  advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
