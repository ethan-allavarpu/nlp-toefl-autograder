My instant reaction on reading the statement was to get defensive and write about how there are several shining examples of youngsters helping their communities. However, I was forced to change my mind as the more I pondered over statement, the more I realised that it is sad, but true.

Young people are often so caught up in their own lives that it has become increasingly difficult to pull them away from their own agenda and try and get them interested in activities which they do not consider 'fun' or 'cool'.

This can be cleary seen even by the amount of time that young people spend with their own families. We find ourselves resorting to using fast but impersonal modes of communication like e-mail and instant messaging even with our parents and siblings. The amount of human interaction has surely decreased. So where's the question of helping out one's community?

However, I think that the main problem is that most young people do not really know how to help their communities. They might also be hesitant as they feel they have nothing special which they can contribute to the community. Once this myth is dispelled, I think that more youngsters might find joy and pride in being part of something bigger than themselves, their community.

Young people, with their natural energy and enthusiasm can come up with bright and innovative ways of helping their community, This can be done in simple but useful ways, such as tutoring some of the younger kids in the neighbourhood, or making a little old lady's day by visiting her in the old-aged home, or even going all out and organising an event for the whole community to take part in.

Therefore, while I do agree with the statement, I also have faith in younger people that they can and they will put their i-pods down for a while, and devote enough time to help their communities. Since no amount of compelling or nagging young people to help out will work, it would be more effective to teach by doing. I feel this can be achieved by getting the whole community involved in a project which everyone finds interesting and can take pride in.
