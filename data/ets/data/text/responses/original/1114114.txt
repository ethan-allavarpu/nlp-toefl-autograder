We are living in an age of information, where the human knowledge of its surroundings has boosted and continues to accelerate even more rapidly. One can tell that today an average high school student, with an average level of education, knows better physics than Newton. With so much information accumulated, the urge for the scientists to specialize in one area to contribute to that area gets more and more significant. There are two major points related with this isue.

First of all, as mentioned above, the accumulation of knowledge in a single area has increased so much that it is impossible to have some discovery on top of it without having the grasp of all prior information. For instance, while most people still have difficulties understanding Einstein and his Relativity Theory, scientists are introducing theories that even extend it, having given a lifetime of study in that subject only. Specialization in a specific topic seems to be the only way of studying science professionally.

Secondly, one can say that it is required to have a broad knowledge of many fields to be able to work on specific topic since scientific fields are highly interconnected and interdependent. This is of course true to some extent. There are many general topics to cover until one has the capacity of advancing to a specialized topic but that does not stand against the fact that academic subjects are now so complex that one cannot afford distributing his effort among various subjects. In fact, the current education system in most of the countries in the world is so: an introductory undergraduate program covering all the required subjects as a baseline, and then graduate studies specializing in a specific subject with the purpose of academic research. 

In conclusion, whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is an important question. While each one has advantages over the other, it seems that specialization is nearly an obligation of modern science regarding its depth and complexity. Specialization is inevitable and must be pursued by every academician, but also not ignoring the background knowledge of the prerequisite subjects.
