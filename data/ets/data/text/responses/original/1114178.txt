Although some may believe young people nowadays give plenty of time helping out their communities, I believe they do not. There are two main reasons: their attitude and lack of time.

First of all, young people nowadays do not have the attitude or motivation to help out their community as they believe it has no benefit on them. These young people believe they do not need to help out their community as they believe other people will do it instead of them or its simply a waste of time. I believe they do not understand the moral of helping the community in need. Furthermore, young people nowadays are a lot lazier than they used to be and so they lack the motive as they consider helping the community will be ''work'', and as we all know, young people tend to dislike work as it is not enjoyable. This motive is probably influenced from school work which is more of a requirement rather than a choice.

Secondly, the fact the world is becoming more competitive and also a lot more interesting, youngsters are becoming more involved in other activities and their studies rather than contributing towards their communities. These young people may have objectives such as going to the best universities or simply enjoying life by relaxing, and in my personal experience, I have never come across a young individual who actually wants to give their time to help their communities. As a result, as young people prefer to spend their time in a different way, there are very little that feels they should help out their communities.

In conclusion, as young people are not tempted to help the community as it is not enjoyable and the fact they have better, perhaps more important things that must be done, young people nowadays do not give enough time nor effort to helping their communities.
