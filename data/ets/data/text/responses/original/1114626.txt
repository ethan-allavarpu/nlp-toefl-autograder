The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a statement I can totally agree with and my opinion is based on several factors.

First off, the main reason of traveling usually is to explore the place visited, and see the beautiful attractions in it. That's why it is necessary to find a professional and experienced local to guide you to the places because he knows his job and he knows what he's doing so he would with no doubt take you to the places often tourists admire like: beautiful scenes and natural beauties.

For an example, I remember when I went with my family to Egypt. I remember we met this young woman who was appointed to meet us as our tour guide. I can't find words to describe how excellent were her choices and how greatly were we satisfied with the places we have seen and the activities we've taken part of, since we saw most of the breath-taking attractions in Giza like: the Pyramids, Sphinx and the national museums in that area where we had this short lesson about hyroglyphs. Also getting a tour guide who's also local can make a splendid combination because you can't find someone who'd try hard to show you places in his town to make you love the place like a local.

Second off all, by getting a touring guide you can avoid some great deal of trouble you may face if you were all alone. Touring guides often accompanied with security guards who're common and familiar with situations that can cause some tourists a kind of unhappiness, or make them uncomfortable or in worst cases be in danger such as: getting caught in the overwhelming traffic, being lost, get a good deal of disturbance by beggars, or even in worst cases being endagered by tourist-targeting criminals.

So that's why I do think that tour guides are a must, instead of going solo, getting unsatisfied with what you see and give the place you visit a bad name as a result of that choice you've taken.
