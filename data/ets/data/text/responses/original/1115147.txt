I agree only partially with the statement that broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better than to specialize on one specific subject.
In my opinion it is not enough to have a vast knowledge in one subject. People tend to be narrow-minded if they do not know about any subject but their specific one. A mathematic for example can make up a theoretic statistic about the spread of a disease for example but he will have to conclude certain irregularities to show the real process.
Furthermore,  a certain amount of basic knowledge is important to everyone to participate in daily discussions or to built up a political attitude for instance. And every employer expects basic knowledge from his potential employees. For example about the current political and economic situations.
Therefore it is definetly important to be familiar with more than one single topic.
Nevertheless, it is obvious that students have to concentrate on one academic topic if they want to compete with others in a job. They have to know as much as possible about this one specific subject and they have to pay attention to learn about the newest changes and innovations in this subject.
And apart from the competitiveness it some situation it could also be very dangerous if someone has only broad knowledge of a subject. A doctor with broad knowledge of medicine for example is the worst imaginable danger.
Apart from that the whole service sector is based on the fact that people know about one single topic in detail while others know about another. Nobody can learn enough about every subject for professionals would be superfluent. 
To draw a conclusion,  students should specialize on one specific subject and apart from that they should learn as much as possible about other subjects. Everybody should use his talent to the greatest extention.
