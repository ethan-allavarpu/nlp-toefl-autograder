Some people believe that it is better for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. They think that students get benefits by studying others ideas and concepts  and use it as a derictory  in thier lives and thier educational  jaurny, they may use as an example for that the old concept about the shape of the earth and how it had been hold until it was aproved.
      I totally disagree with this concept for many reasos, first of all this concepts and ideas might be wrong so it is rediculous to make student hold them.In contrast, we can let them develop thier won under our opservation.Also, some of these concepts are harmful, for example, it is untill recently in my cultural background, poeple inheret and believe the stories about how sertain tribe members are able to come back after thier death. The third reason opposing this concept is that students are the futre. At the time they will be in charge, they need thier won ideas and concepts to deal with it because the every new day the world change.
      In conclosion, I disagree with  the statement because of variation of the relibilty of the ideas and conceps content, the posibility of it is harm, and to allow them develop their own .
