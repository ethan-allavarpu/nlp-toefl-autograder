As the knowledge about science  is expanding, specialization is the result of this expanding. A man can read a lot about a subject but this will be his habbits about an topic.  This is the Filling of spare time, A man can only do on thing or job well but has lot of habbits. 
	Spesification about medicine could be the example. The medical knowledge we have reached today is enormous. A medic can not have all the subjects about medicine experienced. As it is so, it will be superficial and will have less benefit for his or her patients. Thats why medics try to graduate on paediatrics, oncology or cardiovascular surgery. As you uppergraduate on any subgroup, you should know that subject more deeply. 
	But as stated in the first passage, A man can only do one job well, the habbits of him also has supporting effects on his job. As a result, a man also needs habbits, that will support his job. As a result, for this century, spesification is highly required for benefit.
