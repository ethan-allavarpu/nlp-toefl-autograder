Some people may not agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.  But, personally, I think it is really important to try new things and take risks.  Therefore, I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

     Of course, there are some advantages to doing only what people already know how to do well.  For example, if all we have to do in the whole business life is just one thing, it is effective to focus on that one thing and to learn how to do well, without trying new things and taking risks.

    However, in order to succeed, I find more advantages to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.   Like what, I can expand my experiences and diversify my skills.  Moreover, if I only do what I already know how to do well, my experties will be too focused and limited.

     First of all, I hope to expand my experience and diversify my skills through tring new things and taking risks.  I am a businessman working at an investment bank and am required various skills from my customer in the diffrent sectors.  Thus, I need many kinds of experience, skill as well as knowledge to meet the various requrements.  I believe that I can enhance my value as an investment banker by obtaining the wide range of experience and skills.

     Second of all, if I only do what I already know how to do well, my experties will be too focused and limited.  The circumstances in the world changes rapidly nowadays.  If my skill, that is the only experty for me, become out of date, I will lose the competence in the society and will have a poor life. This situation does not mean my success.  In addition to that, I am a person who likes changes, therefore, doing only what I already do might be borering to me. The boring life is not a success for me. 

     My primary consideration with regard to my life is to success by expanding my experiences and diversifing my skills.  Thus, I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
