It is common that many people begin to gain knowledge in a variety of ways. At the same time the question that if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject will be brought about. What do you think of the issue? As far as I am concerned, I will agree with the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. In the following paragraphs, I will add some examples and details to support my point of view.

In the first place, specializing in one specific subject has advantages in various ways, of which, the most significant is that it will save our time and energy. We have to the point out the essencial fact that we do not have enough time to finish every work well, which means that we cannot do good in many academic subjects. If we focus on one subject, we are able to spend enough time on that subject. Therefore, we will have more chances to be successful in the subject we concentrate on. For instance, if a student whose major is computer science studies art to broaden his eyesight, he will not have much time study his major, which will influence his grades and credits. As a result, there will be bad effects on his study. In consequence, we will make good use of our limited time to study, if we concentrate on one subject.

In the second place, what is also worth noticing is that it will bring benefits to our future job, if we specialize on one specific subject.
As we all know, in the future we will find a job which we are interested in. In that case, we should focus on one subject which attracts us a lot. Then we will find a good job after graduation because of our professional knowledge. For instance, if we study biology, we are able to learn more in the subject, which means that we can gain the knowledge related to biology. Therefore, when we have the interview, we will have a lot of academic knowledge to be discussed which will leave a good impression to the manager. We will get the job we want easily.

Admittedly, if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects, we will become knowledgeable. However, if we have knowledge in a variety of aspects and we do not know much about each subject, it will cause bad influences on our future life, which is not good. Therefore I tend to hold the opinion that it is better to specialize on one subject which we have lots of interests and we will get benefits from it.

To sum up, taking into account of what has been discussed above, I can draw the conclusion that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I wish that there will be an increasing number of people who can get benefits from the one subject they specialize in.
