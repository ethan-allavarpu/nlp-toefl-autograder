Everyone has one day dreamt of inventing something new which would make him rich and successful. I must say I believe in people's intelligence. I mean that we are all capable of inventing something which will make us rich. So I do agree with this statememt because being successful is only the last thing you get when you try new things.
When you try new things you do it because you think that what you are trying worth the energy you are spending to do it. You are ready to do whatever it takes to accomplish what you began. You are over motivated and that's why you succeed in you attempt. This motivation shows your ambition and that's how you are going to make it. For example the film Beatrix Potter shows why she became famous, that's  because she knew her idea was good and she had enough motivation to get  refusals and to be desapproved by her father.
And once you have succeed you always want to have this feeling again. The feeling that nothing can stop you, like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, you think you are the king of the world. If you try something new or to invent something it is because you don't like to do always the same thing even you can do it very well. It is a lot more exciting to invent something, to think day and night on how you can develop an idea and make it real.
Finally, you try new things because it makes you successful. You don't like to be like everyone else, you want to be apart of the others.
And even if you are doing something very well you have to try new things or a new way to do it because it will show that you don't rely on your knowledge. It will show that you really want to improve yoursel. Mozart is considered as a genius because he not only knew how to play an instrument very young but also because he created symphonies at a very young age.

As a conclusion I would say that everyone should try new things, it is not interessant to rely on what someone else crated for us. We have the try something new as well.
