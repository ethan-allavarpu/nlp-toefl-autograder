Teaching, learning, studying: it's all a method! During our school and college years, we have all had the chance to experience many teaching methods throughout our professors. When some teachers believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts, other believe that what matters is learning the facts.

During lectures, Professors try to pass along a certain idea or concept to his students. Undoubtedly, lectures are too theoratical and not too exciting, but remain essential.
What will the student remember on the day of his exam from his lectures? What is he supposed to remember?
I believe that part of making studying an enjoyable experience, is understanding the material we are studying. Once we have understood the material, it is printed logically in our heads.

Understanding a lesson begins with understanding the ideas and concepts, as they form the essence of the material. But to understand the ideas and concepts, especially when it comes to complex ideas and concepts, it seems useful to start by learning the facts.
Learning the facts makes you understand the ideas and concepts more easily.

For example, if a student wants to understand Einsten's concept of relativity, a revolutionary concept in physics, it would better to start with the facts. Once the student would have understood the facts about the relativity concept, he could be more capable of understanding the concept as a whole.

Therefore, i believe that it is as important to understand ideas and concepts, as it is to learn facts: the two being linked to one another, leading to a better understanding of the material.
