I completely agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. To support my stand there are three valid points. Firstly ,with the advancing technologies newer and faster modes of transportation are coming up like metros,bullet train,intra city express which makes it very convinient for people to travel from one place to another and actually consumes less amount of time as compared to cars which generally takes more time because of the traffic jams and all. People rather commute to far off places in metros and trains and have already started using their cars as mode of transporatation to nearest station if they have such an option.
                  Secondly, with the arrival of Internet and Video Telecommunication most of the offices find it convinient for its staff to work from their home, eg. Software firms ,Business offices and Corporations related with trading of Shares etc. With this trend on, it will take very few years when most of the people will be working from their homes. This will automatically reduce the usage of cars as most of the people use their cars to go to their respective offices.
                    Finally the most important factor which will determine the reduction in the usage of the car is the scarcity of the fuel. In todays world the consumption of fuel is growing exponentially and it seems there are no means to replenish it ,even though various efforts are being made world wide. With limited amount of fuel supply the world wont be able to sustain the demands of the market and finally, to come up with the solution so as to reduce the fuel consumption, people will be motivated not to use cars and other such vehicles.This will automatically determine less usage of cars in the future years.
                   It might be hard to digest but the way things are turning out to be it seems we will soon stop the usage of one of the most important inventions of human history. And it can be very well assumed that this time duration will be not more than twenty yeras.
