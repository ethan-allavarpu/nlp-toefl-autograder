It is often thought that young people enjoy life more than older people do, but is it really true? A young person and an old person differ completely in terms of social status, experiences, physical abilities and other factors which can explain that statement. Let`s analyze them.


   First of all, old people can sometimes be limited physically because of their age and it can prevent them from doing all they would like to do. Simple things of life can be difficult such as going shopping, driving, or maybe going out with friends. All this difficulties added together can make their life more difficult to enjoy.
   Moreover, older people often have more responsibilities in terms of family or professional goals. This can create a lot of stress, psychological tensions which prevent people from enjoying life at its maximum. However, I have to say that having a family (children...) is not only a source of stress...and can therefore be a great cause of happiness!

   On the contrary, young people are often more `free` psychologically as they are more unconscious than older people and want to experience life in a fun way and to enjoy it. They often do not have the preoccupations linked to a family or a professional situation. Consequently, they can be more selfish and have fun in life.
   We also have to notice that young people often do not have the  same problem of money than when they get older. Most of the time, the parents supply their chidren with money and all their material requirements. It is thus an important worry which dissapears and allows in one sense young people to enjoy life.


   Finally, we arrive to the conclusion that young people enjoy life more than older people do because in a way, they are sometimes unconscious about some worries or problems which can exist in an older person`s life. However, some people prefer to make sacrifices during their youth and then enjoy life when they are older whereas other people make the opposite... But which is the best solution to enjoy life as much as you can?
