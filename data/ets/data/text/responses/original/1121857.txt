  I agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
   First, student must learn  what it is  meaning.  They totally understand the definitions, concepts and the ideas. For example, if a student does not know the definition, he or she could not prove the theorem.  He or she could not combine the two different problems to solve.  If it is not known what the plus mean, it can not be said one plus one equals two.
  Second, knowing the reason or reasons, shows the paths that goes the facts. Students always seek the reasons beyond what they see.  Only the learning the results doesn't enough. They have to ask where is this coming from?
   I think, to do something important we expand our vision and dig deeper than ever. We would expose undiscovered things only when we don't limited ourselves with the given facts.
