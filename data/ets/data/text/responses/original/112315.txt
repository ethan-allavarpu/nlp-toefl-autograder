I agree with this satement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are, because of following reason.
     There are many accidents concerned with over advertisemnts in recently. Because of development of internet, people can buy goods any time they want.  this convenience cause many troubles. People depend on information provided by others who people not know at all.  But,  they have confident information includeing advertisnements on not only internet but also magazines and CMs, because people have not other informetion. So,not only I but also many people feel It is not as wellas the advertisement said.
     In fact, I have an experience. I like to read books and I found an article in internet about a book to find grest book. The book was wriiten about history in which I am imterested. I found,  bought, and read it. However, all I found is this book is boring. the reason I want to read this is the words: this book make a big change on your life, becasue storys i theis book were written interestly. I do not like study history but read about history. I excited it must be written like novels, but the book like a textbook I used in class. So, since this time, I do not buy any books which I can not see the surface.
     Because of the reasons, I agree with that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are. Additionally, compernyes try to make products seems much better. This is also the reasons to make people feel that this is good product.
