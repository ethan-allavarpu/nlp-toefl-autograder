In the past years, we have seen a growing conflict between older and younger people. In many countries, the gap between generations is growing, due to demographic as well as sociological developments.

Unemployment of young people is a hughe problem in many european countries. In many cases, young people are not able to get a good education because of their immigration-background or their social environment. Also, many young people are not able to find proper jobs although they have good education because after massive job cuts in many multinatinal companies, no youngsters are hired at the moment due to slow economic growth and the consequences of globalisation, which often causes outsorcing and transfering of jobs from expensive first world countries to areas, where production is cheaper. 
On the other hand, also older people are affected by these job cuts. At the same time, european welfare-states have to raise the retirement age in order to keep their social systems functioning and financeable. 

Of course, this development sometimes causes frustration on both sides. When older people who either have the will to work but don't find a job or who have worked for decades and are now retired see young people in the streets, hanging out, doing nothing (except skateboarding, listening to music, playing computer games and shopping) they might get the impression, that young people enjoy life more than they do or than they did when they were their age. And that impression, in my opinion, is probably correct. When todays old generations were young, in the fourties and fifties, there was not a lot of fun stuff to do in Europe. They experienced the cruelty of the World War II and the hard work that was necessary to rebuild the countries afterwards.  

Young people in Europe are lucky, to grow up in a safe and often wealthy environment. They have the chance to do things, older people were not able to: they can travel, they can communicate with strangers and friends around the world, they can get to know the world in a totally different way their parents, grand parents and grand grand parents were able to. They have the time and possibility to do sports and ofther fun activities and to enjoy their life - maybe more, or at least in a different way, than many older people do. 
Maybe this way of lifestyle many young people have, containing travelling, extreme sports and other ways to test their personal limits, are a way to cope with their "Zukunftsangst", with the scary feeling many youngsters have, that they have to be flexible all the time, they often don't know, what tomorrow brings them and they are not sure, if and how long they will have a job (and if they are lucky to have a job, they have to pay for the older people's retirement, probalby without beeing ever able to profit from this system themselves).
I think, young people have all rights to enjoy their live as long as they can - sooner or later it will get tough anyway. Older people shouldn't complain about this but rather try to understand the situation, teenagers and twens are in. And sometimes they should even talk to their grand children and tell them: "It's alright, enjoy your life. Go and have some fun!"
