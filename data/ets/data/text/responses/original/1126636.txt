Generally people which are remebered are those who leave a trace of their life in history. Nobody remembers or notice a person whose life has been carried out in an anonimous pattern. We notice what stems out from daylife, something exceptional, new. The key for success is risk. Oscar Wilde used to say that an idea which is not risky cannot be considered as an idea. To give evidence to this statement we are going to outline some main points and then summarize with conclusions and caveats.
     First of all, nowadays we consider successful people who occupy certain social positions due to their efforts in seeking their place. This successful social position varies depending on cultures. Nevertheless, this position is regarded as successful when the position itself is exceptional. Nobody would consider successful someone who works in a normal or standard position. This means that success depends on extraordinary situations carried out in particular conditions: it is finding a new solution, a new idea to obtain something.
     Secondly, people will recognise success only when it is visible. If nothing could lead us to distinguish something from normality, we would not be able to determine the difference between the two. We will not be thus capable of recognising the new into the normal. Hence this will not be differentiable. Success is also difference, uniqueness. In other words new things.
     Third, stated that success is based on difference and new ideas, it is also to be said that news find their root in risk. Elaborating something new, it is not possible to understand whether it will be regarded as something really new and meet the taste of the others or will just fail to communicate its difference. This uncertainty has to deal with risk. To be noticed as different one idea has to be new, thus risky.
     To conclude, we demostrated that success comes from difference from normality; exceptionality and risk. The last factor is perhaps the essential key for success. As Oscar Wilde said.
