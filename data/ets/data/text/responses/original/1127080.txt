                           Do young people enjoy life more than older people do? perhaps it is diffecult to answer because every one of them have their method to enjoy their own life. But in my opinion, old people enjoy life more than young ones because of several reasons so I disagree with this statement.

First, old people have a long experience in life so they know exactly how they enjoy. In contrast, young people do't have enough experiences.

For an example, mybe an young person tried to enjoy by something which is harmful but he didn't know, and after some time he enjured him self. But an old one may have an experience with that thing so he will not try it again. 

Second, even though that young persons have a lot of choises to enjoy but in the sane time they have several things to worry about. For example, their jobs, their business, their family, their healthy and other things that the life now required to worry about .
On the other hand, old persons don't have any thing to worry about except thei healthy.

For example, young person go to the gym to enjoy and whil he excersices he remember something that make him go out from the gym and lose that enjoy time. But the old one will not care about any other thing than his enjoy and his health. 

finally, every one has his own enjoyable.
