Yes, i totally agree with this term of travelling in a group led by a tour guide. It is mainly because as we are a tourist so we dont know much about the places in a particular place. We will visit only those places which are known to us. But if you travel in a gruoup led by a tour guide you will be able to see more new places that u have neevr imagined to see in that particular place. 
The tour guide plays a very important role in making our tour very intresting and adventurous. He tells us about the stories of the different places of that place and make us feel more and more excited to visit that place. 
I visited Agra (India). I was traveling with my friends and we all planned to hire for a tour that is led by a guide so that we can visit more and more places and can come to know about the history of those places. As i know, Agra is a city of history. It have lots of history in it and i wanted to know the proper history of that place. I was sure that only a group tour guide can only tell us about it and i was not wrong at all. He told the whole group about the history of all those historical places in that town. As we know one of the Seven Wonders 'Taj Mahal' is also located in that city. I was touched by listning the history of that Wonder. Not only me but the whole group was touched by what all he told us about it. 
I think i was not in that group with that guide i would have never enjoyed my trip to Agra. As i would not have come to know all wat he told to the whole group. The history of great Taj Mahal. 
Since then i love to travel in a group which is led by a tour guide. Actually what i think one should must visit new places in a group led by a tour guide. Im saying so mainly because you come to know about the places of that town and everything about that town. If you like it then you can come again on your own without a torurist guide. But if you are visitng a new place for the first time then you have to travel in a group which is lead by a tour guide. If you have a tour guide then you need not have to take ant tension for accomodation traveeling from one place to another. All these tasks are done by a tour guide only. We dont even have to buy tickets again and again. In all when we are travelling in a group led by a tour guide we are in a full mood of enjoying. No work tension nothing. Only enjoyment and enjoyment.			
So i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
