Probably in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are now.Today in particulary in Italy there are a very big problem about traffic ,smog,parking,because the mostly of the people has a car.In fact in a normal family there is minimum one car for each,while in a rich family you can find also more cars than the persons,who stay in the family.
In nowdays you can have and drive a car when you are fortheen,the youth don-t drive any more motorcicle,a little special car.
For these reasons in many cities you could-t drive all days of week,for exsample on monday in bologna from 8.30a.m. to 6.30p.m. it-s not apermitted to drive.
It-s a very huge problem also drive in particulary time ,because you spend a lot of time in traffic jum,for exsample when you go to work,and maybe after a long time spends in your car you have to spend more time leave it, because you don-t find parking.
I hope for all these reasons,that in twenty years everything will change.Perhaps in the futere in each town there will be a metro station a good train and bus station,so all the people can may use not their car but the pubblic trasports.In the big cities there is now a  pubblic trasport,but every often is not
