Helping a community is a noble act. And I also agree that youngsters today do not give enough time to help their own community. But it can not be completely attributed  as lack of concern from the young people. There are several reasons for this.

The primary reason is that with so many activites going on parallelly in young people's lives- studies, projects, assignments and other more important commitments that they are left with very little time for themselevs. And so they prefer to concentrate that little time left in their hobbies or some other personal activities rather than helping their communities.

With the advent of television and other media's which has revultionised our lives, we are concerned so much more with what is happening around the world that we actually forget the problems immediately surrounding us. One of my neighbour's is addicted to this one sitcom, which is played everyday night that he actually leaves all his pending work and religiously watches the show. Such is the impact of television on today's generation.

Also there is a growing trend among youngsters especially among the college goer's that such activities are uncool and out of vogue.
So some students deliberately avoid helping a community even if it is against their conscience, just to show that they are cool. To be frank, i myself have witnessed this during my junior college years. 
This kind of thinking which is actually much more prevalent among the youngsters in the urban area's needs radical change. It is really a shame that youngsters today consider such noble acts as cheap and uncool.

But there are some people in each community who after all this things, dedicate some time to such work.
