I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Enjoyment in itself is symbolic for freshness. Age certainly is a big factor in determining the freshness at heart to enjoy life at the fullest. 
The most important factor that supports this idea is that young people are away from responsibilities and day-to-day life woes. They are either dependent on their parents or have some support for themselves. This kind of independence enthuses them to feel free thereby adding on to the fun in their life. Older people are experienced and have families to look upon. Their domain starts and finishes with their families. So their enjoyment is limited to families, colleagues and near-ones. Moreover with the passage of time, the feeling of being satisfied with life increases. The needs shrink to bare minimum and emotional support dominates over feelings of enjoyment. Especially those who enjoyed a lot at a younger age tend to get away from enjoyment in older age. Take for instance, in countries like India and Sri Lanka, older people find pleasure in spiritual activities and become more inclined towards leading an ascetic life refraining themselves from enjoyment altogether. 
Other factor that helps young people to enjoy life more is the state of their health, which certainly is better than older people. As age advances, the body does not allow all activities to be done they could be done during young age. For example young people can have no limits on eating, say, chocolates, but older people can't do so.
Young people, being adventurous at heart, tend to take challenges, make new friends and thus expand their social circle and broaden their horizon. On the other hand, older ones do not mix up so easily and rely on already built up relations. Another argument that favours the statement is that since older people have already enjoyed at some point of time in their lives, so they feel filled and complete in themselves and are left practically with no desire to enjoy. Thus it is quite convincing to believe that young people enjoy more than older ones.
