I myself am considered a young person and live in a community compromising of both young and old. It is a common perception that young people enjoy themselves more than older people do. However, I think this perception is faulty. In fact it is the older generation who enjoy life more.

Youth has many advantages. It is perceived that young people enjoy more because they have more energy, enthusiasm and time. However, what they do not account is the society and its demands. With time our society has been evolving, It has become more demanding, more particular and much younger, Even though the younger generation does have more energy, enthusiasm etc. etc. it does not have then TIME to enjoy. 

"I wish the week had eight days" - this is a common phrase heard from all young people across the globe. Younsters are pushing themselves to become responsible and successful citizens everday. They are always wanting to do more in less time. Their life has peer pressure, study pressure, exam pressure, job pressure, personal pressure. Added to this are various family, friends and other social obligations. There is too much to achieve in such less time. Thus the attributes which should have assisted them in enjoying life more become reason for them to work and achieve more. Time is always short. In this rush of things when does one get time to even breathe?

In contrast, the older generation is at a stage where they have undergone all pschylogical, communal, religious, physical metamorphisis. Thanks to various state and public policies they are no longer financially dependant in old age. Thus they are free to experince life as it is. Though they lack in the attributes favouring the younger generation they compensate by maturity, patience and motivation to truly enjoy life.

It is commonly said "Life begins at Sixty". This is true, because by this age one is free of all responsiblities and obligation and can enjoy life at their own pace. There is true enjoyment only when one has TIME to experience every minute particle.
