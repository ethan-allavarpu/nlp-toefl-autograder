Some people might say that its better to a 'Master of one than being a Jack of All'. But in my personal opinion, its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one. Life is made up of not just thing, but a variety of things and subjects. It is important for any individual to know atleast the basics of almost all, if not all, subjects. Life is integrated with various issues. 

The main reason for me to support that experience and knowledge is needed in various aspects of life is to survive in this constant-changing world. World can take up any turn in any time of life. It is hard to predict the twists in the market. Market in one field can drop down suddenly one day, and all businesses in that field will close. So its better to have knowledge of other fields, atleast the preliminary knowledge and skills so that the person can think of starting up of new business if one doesn't work.

Second point is recreation. If a person knows few more things to do life other than his regular routine work, it will be like a change for him, which he can enjoy and have fun. You get to know more people around you when to interact, and will help to build relationships between them. 

Its a part of our duty to maintain a balance of everything in life. Let us consider one example, currently its the trend of computers and technology, and many people will only take up subjects in Computer science and neglect other aspects like Ecology, Sociology and Economics. Who should care for the betterment and preservation of nature and nation, if no person is knowlegeable about the least the basics of ecology. Everyone should be aware of things taking place in and around his place, his society and nation as a whole.

General knowledge is required to be successfull in life. Every business tycoon in this country has a varied fields of experience and knowledge. If we consider the owner of McDonald's, who is not just a hotelier but a realtor too. Only because of this, he is able to start up millions of McDonald's centers in every busy commercial corner of the World. He integrated his knowledge of marketing and real-estates into the knowledge of food-industry.

Thus to conclude, in my views I feel that to lead an independent and successful life, its necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and strongly agree with the statement.
