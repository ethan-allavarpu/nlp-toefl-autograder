Advertising was created in order to make people buy things. Nowadays, competition is very significant between brands and each brand has to struggle in order to convince people to buy their products. Marketing departments deal with that.
As for me, I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 

Because of globalisation, we can nowadays find almost whatever we want in each country and more particularly in developped countries. Which implies that competition is very rude since there are so many products available for customers. The choice is huge and how can we decide which product to buy when we do not know them?
As a consequence, brands launch many advertising campaigns. They do their best in order to do the best campaign. Thanks to advertising techniques, they enhance their products as much as they can. Because they need to have the product that would the most catch people's attention 

Usually, when someone look at a billboard or watch a commercial on TV about a new food product , it is so well promoted that we are most of the time very interested by the product and we are very excited to go and test it. But we are unfortunately often disappointed. Indeed, if I take the example of a new burger launched by McDonald, the burger will seem very very good in picture. However, when I will go and try it, the bread will be too dry, the cheese will not have the same aspects...And once again, I will wonder why things are almost never the same as in the advertising.

Advertising agencies usually deal with significant budgets and they use amazing techniques sometimes to enhance the product.

Not only, the aspects are not the same, but also the features are not what they tend to be. Actually, some products ensure to do this or this and when you try them, the result is not the one you were expecting. 

Finally, I would like to add that this does not only occur for products but it also happen for famous people. Most of the stars you see in magazine are gorgeous  but in the real life they are not the same, you can be very surprised. All this is due to the marketing that makes everything or evyone being perfect.
