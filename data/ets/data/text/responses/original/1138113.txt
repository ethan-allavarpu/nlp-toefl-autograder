In modern societies people are confrontated with all kinds of advertisements daily. Commercials on TV, huge wall papers and other kinds of advertisments influence and manipulate people to make them buy products. Are these advertisements really truthful though? Or do they promise som things that don't even exsist?

I personally think that most advertisements make products seem a lot better than they really are.We just have to look at TV commercials to realize that they often promise more than the products actually offer. 
Let's look at the pharmaceutical industry for example. Every day we get to hear about new cosmetic products for beutiful skin or pills that help to lose weight. I tried many of these products and I was never pleased with them. 
Another example for false advertising are food commercials. Specific products we see on TV do often seem to be a lot larger than they actually are. With help of computer programs people are able to make their products look better on TV or on a paper. They use specific technical methods to convince their costumers of their items.
A third example for the lacking of truth on advertisements are the methods of politicians to get more votes. They often promise great achievements and advertise with big headlines on wallpapers that they are going to improve the country's situation. I have gained the experience that they usually don't keep their promisses. 

I come to the conclusion that we should be really careful about believing what advertisements promise us. Many of them don't tell the truth about their products. I personally think that these false promises are even the essential element of advertisements. We know that their only purpose is to convince people. Therefor advertisements do always only show positive aspects of their products. Besides our economy puts a great amount of pressure on firms who try to sell products. There is a huge competition between companies and everyone has to sell as many products as possible in order to survive. This forces people to create advertisements that are convincing and persuasive, even if that means that they have to hide the truth and to be unrealistic.
