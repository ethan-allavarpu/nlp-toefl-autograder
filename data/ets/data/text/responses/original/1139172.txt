	I do not agree with this statement, cars have been the most effective tool of tranport for half a century. I don't think tools, such as airplanes, ships, or any other can easily replace cars in twenty years.
	Cars nowadays need petrol as feul, this has become a great problem because the amount of petrol we can gain access to is limited on out planet. Lots of scientists say that as long as we don't find other effective fuels for cars, we wouldn't be able to drive in a few decades. However, corporations such as Toyota, Ford, Hyundai and many others have developed their technology to use hydrogen and electricity as the main power source of cars. Thease cars do not require petrol, and therefore we will not need to find a substitute for cars in twenty years. 
	The world has grown rapidly during the past century. cities expanded its sizes and population saw growth in most cities. This growth brought new needs to people, a fast and cheap transport. Cities have grown enormously, places that we can go in 30 minutes by car would take us a few hours or more on foot. Cars have become a necessary element in modern society. The world is keep growing, cities are becoming even larger, and population is still growing, especially in India and China. The growth the world will see in twenty years will bring more and more needs for cars. Also, cars will become cheaper over time, as it did for the past decades, and it will allow people that couldn't afford cars to buy them, Cars will become more necessary over time.
	During the growth in the past few decades, our cities have developed in a way which it can allow cars to transport most efficiently. Cars were allways taken into consideration, we have roads, underground passges, bridges, parking lots, and all kinds of systems for cars. This system has layed its roots deeply into our cities, and unless we change this whole system during the next twenty years in our cities, cars will still be the most efficient way of transporting, and people will not stop using them. 
	Cars have been by our side for half a century, it has made transport much easier and faster, and it is also becoming cheaper, which allows more people to afford them. As long as there aren't huge changes, or as long as we don't creat a more effective tool than cars, cars will still be in use around the whole world twenty years later.
