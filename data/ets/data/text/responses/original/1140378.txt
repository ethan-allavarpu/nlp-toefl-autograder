Today, young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
I agree partly with the previous statement.The first point, I wuold like to make is that the young people nowadays are very busy with own engangement, that do not have enough spare time. I think, that this is the main motive because young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
As regards me, I am a student at University,I  do not ever have time spare.I am always busy to work to  university.Many time I do not have time to see my boyfriend and my friend, also I have feel to to helping my communities,I do not have time to make it.
Therefore, last years I suceed to organize a big party, in my country, to gather money to helping the poor childern.In addiction, sometimes I helping the children of my country to make homework.
These events seldom happen, because I do not enough spare time. My situation is similar with the situation of my friends.
In conclusion, I think that today,yuong people do not give enough time to helping their communities.In addition, I think that the main reason of this type of bahavior is that yuong people do not have enough time.
