I will explain why I disagree with the statement that in twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

To start with as time goes by more cars are being produced and sold allover the world. 
This trend can be attributed to different factors, such as the world's population growth or the lower cost of vehicles that leads to  higher affordability for the demand.

The population keeps growing as I mentioned and for this reason more people are willing to buy cars. 
Also, as also mentioned above, low cost of production given by modern technologies and new materials allows more people to buy a car.

Another reason that makes more people willing to get a car is given by the improvement of the transportation system pretty much allover the world. We see big highways and roads being built every day so that more places in the world become better connected to each other.

There are many countries, such as Italy for example, where the public transports system is not fully developed, for this reason a growing number of people prefers to have its own car rather than to rely on a way to travel that is not as efficient.

A psychological reason also explains why more cars will be seen in twenty years from now than today; the society tends to be very individualistic and less social than it used to be. For this reason more people prefer to be independente when they get around and the car becomes their own shell. 

Cars cannot be replaced simply because people need them to go to work, to travel, to see places in complete freedom; sometimes peole just want to get the pleasure of driving them and feel a sort of freedom.

Because of all the above reasons I believe more cars will be produced and sold in the future, therefore in twenty years from now we will see more cars  than today, not fewer.
