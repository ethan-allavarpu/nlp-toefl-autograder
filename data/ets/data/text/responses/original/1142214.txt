I agree with the statement that, "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are." My opinion about this topic is based on personal experiences as well as personal opinions. 
	Who has not seen an advertisement that appealed to his/her own needs and wants? Furthermore, I will go a step further and say that I am sure that almost everyone has bought a product because he/she remembered an advertisement about it. Advertisements are temptous and play with the customer's emotions. In addition, the way they are put together they appeal to the viewers' eyes; it makes them want to have whatever is displayed on the advertisement. In the center of Advertisements is usually a woman with a perfect body,  few clothes, a big smile. Moreover, this kind of advertisement makes woman want to be her and men want to get her. At this point the product being sold is not as important as the emotion involved in the advertisement. For example an advertisement for a cigarettes company sells a cancerous stick to people by presenting a tan, attractive, and good-looking woman with a glowing cigarette in her hand on a huge billboard. Do people  really want to start smoking or rather be as good-looking as the woman. Now, this supports the fact that the advertisement makes the product seem much better than they really are. 
	Another point to be made in this commentary about the statement is that even is people do not try to be influenced by the products sold on advertisements, they are still influenced by them. As soon as people leave their house they are surrounded by advertisement on huge billboard, on trucks driving by, on school blackboards, or in magazines and newspapers. These advertisements will store subconsciously. If people then go to the crocery store to make their weekly supplies they will remember what they saw on the billboards. They might buy those products and recognize that what they bought was not as good as they thought it would be. They are surprised by the fact that the advertisements sold them this product and, more important, made it look better than it actually was. 
	In conclusion, it seems athat in today's world we are surrounded and enclosed by advertisements and  people who try to sell things. This is the reason why it is hard to distinguish whether the product being sold is actally worth buying or if it is just trying to trick our eye. It is important for people to recognize that not everything advertised will have exactly the same effect on everybody or will taste the same way to everyone. But also I  had to make the experience first before I recognized that "advertisements make products seem much better than they really are."
