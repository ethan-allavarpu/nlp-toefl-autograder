Nowadays students have lost their interest on the procedence of ideas and concepts. As time goes on, there are fewer students interested in answering questions such as "How Newton's law was conceived and what is its mathematical basis?" or "how steel was first created from its natural constituents?"

Students are loosing that curiosity in how facts are conceived due to lack of interest in things they think already exist and do not need to be studied again by them because it was already clarified centuries ago by someone else. Insteed they rather learn and understand the final results obtained years ago, which have been put under evaluation several times through all these years.

To explain further this point, let us take a look at the two examples mentioned at the beginning of this essay: Newton's law. Back in Isaac Newton's time it surely was surely important to prove his second law of motion by measuring the time a body lasts in free falling motion frorm a determined height. Nowadays students do not care for proving this theory by implementing their own experiments: they rather studied the formula developed by Newton and applied it in a physics problem with only one purpose: to get a good degree at the end of the course.

Now let us take a look at the second example: the manufacture of steel. There is a big theory on this field and research is still carried out on it. Many cultures were involved in the early years or the iron era, and a lot of experiments were carried out to study how iron reacted with air to produce steel: many manufacturing thecniques were studied to come with the idea of using high temperature furnaces to produce steel. This last result is the one that matters for students; they are only interested in understanding how steel is formed in a chemical reaction in order to get a good grade once again. They do not care on proving themselves that steel can be manufactured in such ways.

The reason why students act this way has already been mentioned: they are told to wory only about a degree, and they are not allowed to let the minds think about what they really like. It would be better if students were allowed to study what they really like. In this way, a students who really likes chemistry and physics will be surely wondering about the facts, while a student who wants to developed an artistic talent such as painting, does not have to worry about things he does not really care.
