Some people like trying new things and take risks. By contrast, other people always do what they already know well. there are some advantages and disadvantages to both ways. However, I believe the saying:"No pain, no gain". Trying new things and taking risks are worth doing.
First of all, succes comes from innovaton and risk. History shows that only brave and creative people have made impact on human life. For instance, Thomas Edison invented light bulbs. During his work, he tried thounsand kinds of materials. He did not succeed until he found last one. In fact, he was not sure if he would find the right material all the way throgh. He took more risks than others could bear to. As a result, his courage and perseverance has changed our life.
Secondly, people are scared to try is because they are afraid to fail.
Nevertheless, failure is the mother of success. Even though after all the hard work they may fail, the experience they acquire is valueless. The new gained precious experience will in turn lead them toward to their destiny. This is a common process to success. Without trying, this process will never happen.
Thirdly, staying where one is will eventually make him fall behind. In the 21st Century, everyone is trying to overcome any adversary to achieve their goals. If someone stops progress and does what he already knows how to do, he will be left behind. Therefore, taking risks and breaknig the mold is the only way to survive in this competitive society.
Overall, in one's success and victory, trying new things and taking risks are the two vital factors. As people try to advance, the ones who stays the same are determined to be the last ones of the race in life. Only improvement brings a eternal success to a person.
