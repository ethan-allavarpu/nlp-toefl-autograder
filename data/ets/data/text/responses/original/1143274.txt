"Mom i do not want to to study these theories again and over again" said my little child, so many questions about this crossed my mind like; what is really more important for a student to know, understanding ideas and clear perceptions or take facts as they are printed in their text books?

This issue that describes the types of learning, is really a contreversial issue for plenty of reasons, and as learning is concerned, i wish to see changes in the learning ways at many levels and angle., I personally, strongly believe that a person in general, should be given the opportunity to understand the ideas and concepts,first, becasue that is what shape a person's personality, let us take  young children as an example, most of these children have their personalities shape when they turn  ten years old, because all the abundant perceptions,knowledge, ideas and even things which they like and things,  which they  dislike  have already  configured, a soldier is  another example, this fighter learnt the concept of loving his country when he was a kid,did not he ?!!

Another thing i would really do, if i had the chance to change something in how our young students should be tought, that i would build a whole city of learning, and i would make it unique in its given courses, it would be built based on the concepts of loylaty, love, team work and encouraging individual talents, moreover, no normal test would be giving, because they would be tought that the concept of examination is not always the right concept, also they would have weekly debates about larger concepts like enthusiasm, ethics, aesthetics and racism to have these young generations prepared to involve in real life life.

in conclusion, learning concepts is the best way for  someone to have a balanced  family,community and even country, because it is a circle of wise ideas, which never fails ,in my opinion,no wars no violence would be existed if evaluating our concepts and respecting other concepts were every body's dream to fulfill.
