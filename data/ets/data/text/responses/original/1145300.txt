Advertising in the art of convincing customers to buy specific products. It is obvious that advertisements do not provide a complete information to the customers. That is not the original purpose, even if it provides sometimes useful information, and other ways exist for customers to get information about the products they want to buy. For example, a lot of independent websites compare all the models of the same product available in the market.
But even if advertisments are not supposed to provide a complete information, they often describe some features of the product. Doing that, they can not lie about objective characteristics because it is not legal and the advertisement would be forbidden by the competent authority.
  Then, how advertisements can lie to the customers? The way to describe a product can be very subjective and it is obviously the case for advertisement. For example, if you present a car with very beautiful girl or boy driving it, you don't lie but you give the illusion that the car is better than it would be with a normal driver. That is seduction. A advertising is seduction. When you are interested in someone and you have a date you do not wear every day's clothes. You take more time to appear "much better than [you] really are". That is seduction too and nobody seems to be against this kind of "subjective lies". 
  In my opinion, the statement "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are" is true but that is not a problem because everybody know that advertisements are subjective. There is a game of seduction between companies and customers. We have to know the rules and take part of the game. I think that the life would be less interesting without this kind of subjective communication, beyond technical descriptions.
