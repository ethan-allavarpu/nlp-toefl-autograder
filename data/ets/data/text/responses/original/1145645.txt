i agree with the statement successful people try new things .Because if they try the new things then only they will success in life oterwise their life is stationary.

If we want success and growth in our life or in job definitely we need to try new things and then only we will overcross other competetors and succeed in life.
so i storngly agree  with the statement all people succeed by trying new things in
