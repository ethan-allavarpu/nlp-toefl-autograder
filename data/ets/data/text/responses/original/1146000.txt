I personally agree with the statement that "Young people enjoy life more than older people do" not only beacause they are physically more fit to do so, but also because their outlook on life is full of illusions and great dreams.

Young people's first advantage is thier physical condition due to their age.  They have a vigorous body and therefore a vigorous mind.  Mix these with a good moral education and a spirit for adventure and the result can be a young adult that truly and deeply enjoys his life.
On the other hand, older peple tend to be limited by their deteriorating body and have to deal with a limited diet and activitiy plan.  They can have the moral base and the unbreakable spirit of a young person, but thier bodies will not keep up with these for a long time. It is obvious that the range of physical activities available to young people in life is much greater than that available to old people. Sky diving, snowbording, rock climbing are some examples of activites off-litimts to older persons.

The second advantage young peopel posess is their fresh outlook on life.  This view of  thier lives has not been tarnished by mistakes, torn relashionships, of failed attempts.  Their emotions are strong and every new detail life brings to them is embraced with passion.
Older people tend to carry around old memories of lost loved ones, of failed attempts, torn relationships, mixed feelings, which in turn drane spiritual energy that would otherwise be used in more effective ways to enjoy life.  A younger person has a better of acomplishing his life goals because he doesn't waste valuable energy in regrets, or regrets.

In conclusion, young people have a better chance than oler people to enjoy life at its fullest, because of physical and emmotional advan
