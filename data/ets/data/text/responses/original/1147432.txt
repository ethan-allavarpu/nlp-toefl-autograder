in the world there are people with different behaviour, traditions and ways of think. Moreover there are people more or less rich and the statement young people enjoy life more than older people is not always true above all for the african, asian and south american people where young people are like older people because they are in a difficult situation and they must work. I live in Italy and I see that in Europe the situation is different because youg people have parets with a secure work so boys like me can live a beutiful life while older people like my parents can work for me. I think that older people live in different ways respect youg people so they enjoy life in other things.
