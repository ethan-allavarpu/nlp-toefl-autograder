I agree with the statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Here are the reasons why.
	First, advertisement tend to over exeggerate the effect of the product. For example, many cosmetics claim in their advertisements that they have speical elements that make your skin white within just two weeks or make your face looks better. When you see the advertisement you will be attracted by the slogans or marvel at its magical effect, and you will buy it. There's no solid evidence or medical reports that proves that the product is that useful, but the advertisements often use beautiful models and exaggerate speech to convince you to buy the product. 
	Second, the advertisement  is a work being thoroughly and specially designed. Through the lightening and computer adjustments, the product can be seen perfect in the advertisements. Take the shampoo advertisement as an example, the model's hair always look so shining and smooth in the ads after they use the shampoo. However, the hair is very artificial. There is no way people's hair can be that perfect, but the company that produces the shampoo spends a huge amount of money on the filming to make you believe that their shampoo is really that good.
	Finally, the advertisement is often selling a concept of lifestyle, not the product itself. It is not the product that is apealing, but the ideal lifestyle beneath it that attracks you. The product can be bad, but as long as you want to have the lifestyle that the advertisement promote, you will buy the product. For instance, in a house ads that emphasize on the idea that single woman can live alone happily, the house itself is not that important. It is the wish to live as a happy single noble that makes you want to buy the house.
	To conclude, the advertisement is a carefully designed work that promotes concept and often exegerates the product. Thus, it makes the products seem much better that they really are.
