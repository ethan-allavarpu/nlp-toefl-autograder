A world with fewer cars!Sounds preposterous now. But I think this is going to be a reality in  twenty years from today. There are various reasons why I hold  this opinion. These include population growth, fuel crisis, and popular consciouness about environment. 

The population of the world is only growing by the day. Naturally, we would expect more cars to roll on the roads. But , we do not realise that land is not growing in proportion to people. With limited land , there will come a time when we will not be able to find more space for our cars. Then the recourse is mass rapid transport system, which discourage car-use. This has already been seen in Delhi, India's capital city where Delhi Metro Rail system has been created to deal with the stress that increasing vehicular population was creating. Now , we see that the number of cars have indeed come down on the roads because people find it more convenient to take a train to office, at a negligibel price, rather than maintain an own car.

Another reason why the number of cars might go down is the shortage of fuel. Oil crisis is here for real. It is becoming increasingly difficult to satisfy the energy need of the world. Very soon , the prices of oil are going to increase very highly. Early signs can already be seen. In such a case, running a car can be very expensive. Research on alternative fuels, like biofuels or solar power, is still in nascent stage. Thus, it will be very difficult for the common man buy fuel for his car. In India , the price of petrol has been increasing steadily and my family now goes out in car, only when it is really necessary or when all the four of us have to go out together. Otherwise, we use bikes or, simply, the public transport system. 

The last reason why I think that cars are going to be fewer is popular sentiment against environmental pollution. Cars use fuel which increases environmental pollution. Therefore, some countries, like those in the Nordic region, encourage their citizens to use bicycles which are more eco-friendly. They are also a healthier option in comparison to cars as they keep the rider fit. Thus, concious citizens support such ideas. This trend seems to be catching up, which makes me believe that it will in future become very popular. In that case, the prospects for cars look bleak.  

To conclude, I believe that cars are going to become rarer in the years to come because of a variety of factors. These include  shortage of two resources: land and oil. These are going to be scarce because of growing population, in which case cars will not be viable. Finally, when people become more eco-friendly, they would look for options other than cars, which will affect the prospects of these automobiles.
