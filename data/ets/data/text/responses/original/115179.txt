I do agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and with good purpose. The main focus of advertisements is to make it seem that the product is the best thing in the world, that it is  completely necessary and the most important of all, to sell the product to make profits which equals money. A good example of these reasons are: diet pill campaings and ads on television. They make ordinarily difficult goals to obtain, obtainable making it seem easy, fast and without breaking a sweat. First of all, they target the one thing humans are concerned about : their psychical beauty specifically lossing,gaining weight or being healthy. Todays men and women understand the importance of having a healthy body and being in shape for different reasons these being: health related issues such as heart disease, diabetes , morbid obesity , etc... and other more psychical reasons are: the stereotypes of being pretty and skinny in a judgemental society that trives on superficial beauty. Healthy bodies and weight loss come from: healthy eating habits, exercise and well organized planning.  Diet pills advertisements make it seem as if you could skip all of these steps and still achieve your goal of a healthy shape and body, which in irony is not healthy or recommended by doctors because the risks are endless. Still people buy these products because they want to be the lovely young lady with the tight body or men want to be that guy with the washboard abs to feel good psychically and mentally. To understand how this operates we must look for the obvious reasons of why the product would seem much better. First of all , the image of expressing the easily unobtainable as obtainable is key in selling the product and therefore making more money and secondly when watching a television ad look for the little black paragraphs in which the truth about the product is stated and they don't want you to know quickly. This isn't a new practice every product will seem the best to make a profit out of it, but it is up to us to be educated and be informed about the product we hear or read about  to make a wise decision when purchasing it.
