Advertisements often tease the pospective customer with the newest, most advanced and simply coolest goods or services. To be unique in a diverse market environment it is  literally inevitable to cheat the buyer.
Advertisements have to have a short and stong message. Due to this briefness it is impossible to present the product in an appropriate and honest way. 
Consumers who bought a product which was advertised as reliable or easy to use often are unsatisfied with what they finally hold in their hands. But who is to blame? Of course the companies are presenting the products in the best possible way, that's what I would do too. On the other hand we, the customers, don't want to hear lenghty advertisements in which products are explained in detail. 

The phenomenon of wrongly advertised products is not a new one. In my opinion people should be clever enough to know that companies say whatever it takes to sell a product. 
For example when a cellphone is advertised the commercial could say: The best cellphone ever built. This statement, of course, cannot be prooved by anyone. Therefore we have an exageration and probably even a false statement.
Another example is food and drinks. How can a commercial seriously say: The most delicious burger ever. A customer who buys and tries it ultimately has the expectation of a great burger. But what if he doesn't like it. This means the advertisement industry is neither able to shape our taste nor to advertise products in a proper way.

So far I have been describing the black sheeps among the advertising companies. Nonetheless there are companies who present their products honestly without exaggerations or even lies. Especially when comparisons are made the customer can be sure to watch a good advertising.

In the end it's all up the the prospective custome whether a commercial is believed or not.
