I agree this choice this young people because I use my holiday to help the children with some problems, not in Italy, but in others country, when the help is need. I prefer the children because are fantastic, and teaching more.
But I don't agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities, because as always there is who that helping other or your communities and who prefer to spent his time in others mode. 
As in all there is good and no good.
I hope that the adult o old people see this young.
