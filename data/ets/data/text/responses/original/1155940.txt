Young people nowadays often live in a society where education and work becomes a more and more difficult task due to high competition. Today's young people also live in a modern world with much more accessible distractions than before.

On the one hand, I think the society we live in has become highly competitive in all aspects. Since good education is becoming more and more accessible, universities, companies now require an even higher level of education. In my opinion, that is why some people now work harder than before.
On the other hand, the invention of computers, video games, and all the other different accesories made the young people of today much busier.

These reasons are why I agree with this statement in most cases. I think that young people nowadays simply don't have the time to help their communities. I also think that these young people are not to blame, modern society is.

If I talk about my personal experience, I can say that I do not give enough time to helping my community. One of the reasons why I don't is because nobody encourages me to do it. People around me are becoming less and less aware of the problems in their communities and are becoming more selfish.

I think it is also important to say that it is not 100% true that all young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. I think it applies more to rich and weathy countries. In the third world countries, I think people are more aware of poverty and as a result are less distracted by all the new technologies.
