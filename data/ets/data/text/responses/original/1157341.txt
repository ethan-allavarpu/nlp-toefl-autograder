Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
I completely agree with the statement above. Albert Einstein quotes, "Try to be a man of value and not a man of success."  Success follows people who are innovative in their ideas and are expressive to present them freely. Albert Einstein never set out to come up with the "Theory of relativity". It was his desire to explore and question every aspect of everyday life which brought him the fame to be the inventor of "Theory of relativity". 

Constant change is the human nature. And the people who bring about this change in an evident manner are the ones who are ready to think out-of-the-box. Centuries ago, everything was done on paper, stories to accounts, medicine to religion etc. Today, everything is written on tape drives and stored electronically. Thanks to mankind, who was constantly looking for options to change. We went from pen to typewriter and then to computer and to super computers today. The numerous inventions made in every field of life are all because some one somewhere was thinking beyond the ways which they know how to do well. It was the quest to do things better and add value to what is being done today, which led to new discoveries.

Take an example of Bill Gates, he is successful today because he started Microsoft, a Windows operating System which sits in almost every household today. His desire to do something new brought him this fame. And his quest to constantly bring about the change to the world is keeping his success intact.

In summary, it is seen all around, people who have taken the risk to do something new are the ones who got success and fame.
