In my opinion there is no single correct answer to this question. Of course both ways can lead to success. My main reasoning is that it depends on the path one wants to follow whether an academic specialization makes sense or not. My aim is to explain this argument in the following sentences by looking at the broad academic field of business.

In Switzerland, a masters student can choose whether he wants to specialize in one specific subject - as finance - or to keep his focus on a broad approach which includes subjects such as marketing, human resources, finance, strategic management, risk management, leadership.

To illustrate my hypothesis mentioned above I will now have a look at two different jobs within a company.

A general manager and his management team need not to be specialized in one specific subject as they have to address problems of many different fields - such as leadership issues, marketing decisions and financial topics. An important aspect in the job of a manager is the need to quickly decide on many different issues. Thus a broad education is actually an advantage.

An employee in the financial sector such as in a bank does not need to have such a broad knowledge. Rather it is essential that he possesses in-depth knowledge of the transactions within the sector and on the sector itself. The job requirement is much more focused. Rather than just knowing little about everything it is advisable to have a solid knowledge of this special topic - and finance for example is actually still a rather broad subject.

But of course it is needless to say that knowledge is allways an added asset. However one has to decide first which path will be chosen in order to be able to make a sound decision whether an academic specialization makes sense.
