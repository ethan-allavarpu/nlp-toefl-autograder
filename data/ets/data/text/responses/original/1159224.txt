In todays world of cut throat competition, advertising plays a major role in increasing the sale of any product.There is a large variety of products available in the market today.Similar products are manufactured by many companies.Hence customer today has a variety of chooice.
      The differences in these similar products may be very minute. The advertising helps in exaggerating this diffeences.Take cars for example.One car manufacturer may exaggerate about the spaciousness in the car by comparing it to a lounge ambience in its advertisement.Another car manufacurer in the same category may emphasize on the outer design of the car comparing it with the aerodynamics of a spaceship.Thus both the manufacturers have a selling point to be amphasized.
      But as the saying goes looks can be decieving because all that glitters is not gold.There are so many instances in which the customer is fooled into buying a product because of the galmour created around it through advertising.These instances are coming to life almost everyday.There  are many letters in the 'letter to the  Editor' columns of newspapers that highlight this point.Let us consider a simple example of buying an apartment.One of my close friends wanted to buy a new apartment.He collected many brochures and visited many incomplete sites of construction.He decided to finalize on the basis of the brochure comparison.The brochure of the apartment he zeroed on spoke about the spacious rooms, facilities like gym, sauna, play park and many more amenities.After actually shifting to the apartment he was surprised to see big spacious rooms accompanied with lot of plumbing problems, no gym, the sauna without water in the pipes and so on.But if the advertisement hoardings were to be followed, this was a dream apartment.This is a common case for a large variety of products.
     Going from the advertising point of view, the advertisers are paid to make the products look good even if they actually arent.Take an example of a popular razor which shows leading sports personalities using it.This razor actually caused skin problems to a customer according to a news paper.But the company that made this ad made profit and successfully helped in selling the product.
     There are many more instances which help in supporting the statement that advertisements do make products look much better than they actually are and I completely agree with this notion.
