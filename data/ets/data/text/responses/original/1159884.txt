The issue of whether young people these days, give enough time to helping their communities or not, is an issue that has been debated on extensively over the last few years. I personally dont agree with the statement as i feel that young people still play their part in helping their communities. The issue comes up again and again because people just take the actions of these young people to heart without actually understanding the situations they face and seeing how things have changed for these young people over the years. 
        First, i have always noticed that it takes a thousand good deeds to be appreciated and  just one bad deed to be cursed. Very often the actions of one person are taken as the trait of a group of people without actually knowing what these other individuals are like. A few bad examples have helped promote the idea that the young people nowdays dont care.
        Secondly, a lot has changed in the life of young people. The world is a great deal more competitive today than it was ten years earlier. Everything from an education to an occupation demands much more. Time cannot be taken for granted anymore and young people find themselves more and more time bound everyday. I dont think this aspect is completely understood. Yet you see these young people doing the best they can to help their communities. A simple example of this is how at the time of someones death everyone is there to lend a helping hand to the family which has suffered the loss, and at such occassions if you try to think about it its usual the young people who run around to help all the time.
        Moreover, there are so many young people who have dedicated almost all their time to sever and help their communities. there so many young people either involved with or running NGO's or organisations which deal with serious issues like education or ample food and shelter for their communities. These people have devoted all their time and energy for the betterment of their communities.
        In the end i would just like to say that, there might never be a common agreement on this subject, but i firmly feel that the young people are doing their part. I guess all we really need to do is open our eyes and see the bigger picture and i have feeling that the results, like me, might not support the statement either.
