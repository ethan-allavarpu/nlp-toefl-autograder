You often hear that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I also agree with this statement.
There are several reasons why I think so.

The first is that the costs to drive and possess a car would be much higher than today. Because the price oil would get higher. Also today you can see this, because in the last years the price for oil is exploded. And also the taxes for cars would raise because the government cares about the environment and needs money. So not every person will have the money to use a car.

Another reason why cars will be get fewer is that there will be a lot of other options to come from point A to point B in the future. For example a transrapid will be built in munich in the next years. So many people would not use a car if they have the possibilty to go by the transrapid. And  today many people research for new ways of transport people that are not as bad for the environment as cars are.

A third reason is, that more and more people move into  the big citys to get a job. So there will  be more people in the bigger cities of the country. And in big citys you normally don't need a car. I think so because with the car you need su longer than if you user other possibilitys because there a many traffic jams in bigger citys. For example a friend of me studies in munich and he needs with his car one hour to come from his home to the university. With the bike or the subway he only needs half an hour. So I think many people will then use a bike or go by subway. 

For conclusion you can say, that there are a lot of good reasons why in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today.
