Does young people enjoy life more than older people do? If I am asked to answer this question, I would say no. Many older people think and say that young people have freedom and they can do whatever they want. However, that is not true for young people because there are many things to do for young people befor they become an adult.

As a young person, I feel like I have very limited life. Teens go to school everyday, they have to do their homeworks and projects, and they also have to prepare to go to college. Preparing for the college gives a lot of stress to young people because most of the students want to go to good colleges. In order to go to good college, they need to work hard in school and also they need to do many extracurricular activities. Even though they have something that they want to do, either there are no free time for them or there are things that is not allowed to young people. Also, in order to achieve their goals in the future, it seems it is necessary to go to college and study in the field they want to study. Without that education, it is hard to get a job in the high position or to earn a lot of money. 

Not only that, but also they need to listen to their parents because they are not adult yet. If the parent don't agree with something that you want to achieve, you need to either give up or change your mind. There is actually no freedom for teens at school or at home. Older people are more able to do whatever they want because they have freedom and they don't have financial problem because most of them work. Basically, they can buy anything they want without asking or getting permission to their parents, and they can also do whatever they want without being pressured under parents. 

We don't exactly know when a young person becomes a older person, but what we know is that when a person becomes old enough, they can enjoy their life doing whatever they want and they have more freedom than the young people.
