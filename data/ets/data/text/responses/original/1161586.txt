People are always tending to pursue the most that they may obtain. When it comes to  the aspect of knowledge obtaining, the situation is similar. However, sometimes they have to choose whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject. For myself, I will choose the latter, but will try to get some balance as well.

Nowdays, knowledge is exploding everyday, as a result, it is rather difficult for one to learn broadly and deeply at the same time. Having broad knowledge seems attractive, but actually, it is not practical after the second thought. In the academic circle, there are experts and authorities in almost every field, all of whom hold some specific research interests and accompishment of their own. If one just spend most of the time on learning knowledge of many subjects, he or she may not have the time to do related research. Besides, since it is quite easy to gain information currently, it is not necessary to know all, for if you want, you can look the needed information soon.

However, if one specialize in one specific subject, things will be quite different, especially when he or she choose a valuable but rarely-touched field. Under this situation, he or she will become the expert in this field and it is possible to do some quite profound research on it, which will be more benifitable if one knows about a lot but really knows little on each subject. As long as the researchers are willing to share their results, communicat to each other, and do teamwork when it is necessary, it does not matter whether all these researchers are able to have broad knowledge.

At the same time, to keep some balance, it is also important for a researcher to know some basic knowledge on related subjects, which could broaden the eyesight and inspire him or her fresh ideas. Besides, this will not waste too much time.

To sum up, generally, I think it is better for one to specialize in cetain subject, but it will be good to know some concerning knowledge at the same time, which can make the work most effectively.
