I agree with it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learm facts.
bucause today at every school, every students only learn fact.
even they do not understand what teacher talking about.
I think it is not good for young students. if teacher read and teach what is on the book, they would think about same thing.
In addition, It would make children's free imagination down.
getting down student high score is one of the big problems in 
the world. especially in japan, I heard on the television that there is no student who read a book often, do not like learn new things and they do not know why is so imprtant to do study.
I think all teacher must teach childrens to get interested in to
know new idea, not only the fact.
children should think about their own ideas.
It will makes them more intelligent and interested person.
other big problem is most of japanese can not speak english.
and I saw the graph on the news, They said japan was worst.
in the high school, student  will learn english form  teachers who is not native speaker. they studies such as grammer and how to talk.
I think it is not very useful for students.
they have to learn listening, writing and need chance to talk to people who speak english.
It will also make student to intersted and  easy to undersatnd in class.
I do not think only learn fact is bad but I guess If student learn that,
They would lose their indivisual idea and sense of imagination.
that's why I think, to understand ideas and concepts is more important to learn real facts.
