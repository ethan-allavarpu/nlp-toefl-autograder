Does success come to you or do you come to success? Would doing only what you are used to do be proficient to take it to another level? The key to success often comes with a certain risk involved.

Observing successful people you often find a pattern that those people are open to new ideas, will go new ways and broaden their vision continously. The are not shy to take risks, and thus help progress to be made.

If one only did what he used to be doing for years, his vision would narrow and his success be steady. Many people succeed not in doing the same year in, year out, but in breaking out of their usual work pattern. Certainly, this very step involves a lot of risk. If you fail, you might lose your job. If you invest lots of money, it might be lost. If your are working with hazardous materials, you might risk your health or even your life. But technical progress hardly would have been made if it was not for people who risked their lives in order to find ways to improve airplanes, cars or machinery.

If no one dared to award Larry Page and Sergej Brin with two million dollars in 1998, Google would not have revolutionized the internet.
Now, it paid off a millionfold.

Risks have to be taken, and people need to be open to new ideas to develop them further, to try them out and to eventually decide whether they are worth it or not in, order to gaining a competitive advantage over their rivals. 

Nothing is secure, and nothing is to be gained if we just stuck with what we know, and only in very rare cases success and development comes to us. In most cases, we have to work hard for it, never knowing whether it will pay of.

One of the best examples might be stock brokering. Is he most successful who always went for the safe bets? Generally, the highest revenues are made through investing in the more risky stocks. And only those who are open to take the risk will succeed long-term in this market.

Being open to new things and daring to take risks brings you further than just go with the normal daily routine.
