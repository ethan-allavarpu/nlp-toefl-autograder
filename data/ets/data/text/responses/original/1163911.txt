One thing history teaches manking is that extremes are never the best solution. They might serve ones purposes for a short term, but on the longer run they usually reveal their shortcomings.

The very same rule can be applied in this case.

At a first glance, the advantages of a specified knowledge seem to be overwhelming. Nearly every modern companie or even scientists in universities serve as good examples. To be successful in your part of busines, you have to know everything about it, and additional knowledge only serves as distraction. Since the times of big breaktrough-inventions are all gone, everybody specializes on a very narrow field. On a small subject, we now have an absolute expert, knowing nearly everything about it. To a certain extend this is absolutely necessary. Who else can deal with nano-composites, for example, exept someone who has studied this subject for many years? But as soon as an wider overview is needed, this type of scientist very often fails How can he know about new methods in medicine, that might well be adopted within the field of nano composites, if all they ever studied are nano-composites? It is therefore possible, that lacking interdisciplinary skills often result in disadvantages. Furthermore, a person with a tremendous amount of knowledge on only one field most definitely lacks interest in other things, and therefore misses so many things in life. 

The other extreme would be people who know something about everything, but nothing of importance about any specific field. While these scientists might have the interdisciplinary skills, they would certainly lack the knowledge they need to combine anything of real use and importance. There is simply no need for these persons in academia, since a certain understanding of specific problems is always needed.

I therefore strongly support the idea of a combination of these two types. Of course I am aware of the fact, that we can never gain specific knowledge on all academic subjects. This will remain an illusion.

I favor the humanistic approach. Specialize on one or two subjects, but never loose your abilitie to overview a wider field. If you are a mechanical engineer, don't loose your interest for theatre.
