I agree that in twenty years, advancement in convenience of public transport and/or concerns for the environment will decrease the number of cars in use than there are today.
Public transportation will prove to be more efficient than owning a private car. Not only does is save money, but it also saves time. Using public trasportation will save money in two ways. Firstly, the expenses on fuel would be cut to zero. Secondly, one no longer has to spend money in car maintenance. Adding to that, using public transportation will also save time because there will be less traffic. This is proved especially true in subways. Because of these increase of benefits in using public transportation as technology advances, the population who would prefer owning a car would dwindle.
Another reason that the number of cars are going to decrease is that there are growing concerns for the environment. Environmentalists have been active in promoting the conservation of nature through media. They have successfully managed to alert the world about the seriousness of global warming and have also educated society on ways to prevent a serious disaster. These same Environamentalists have convinced many that preservation of nature is highly urgent. Also, they have stated that the earth will run dry on fuel in a few years. Thus, increasing amounts of people who abide to such beliefs will result in the decrease of car usage. 
In conclusion,  because of the effectiveness of public transportation and concerns for perserving nature, less and less poeple would be willing to own cars. When public transportation saves money and time compared to owning a personal car and when the earth can be subject to serious catastrophe because of your use of cars, could you possibly purchase a car?
