Travilling is sometimes for holiday and seeing new places but sometimes it is for job. For the first,  you can travel yourself or travel with a group led by a tour guide. Sometimes you need the first one, sometimes the second one. I disagree the statement ; The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. It change according to the your physchology or your destination, that can be abroad or inside of your conutry. I prefer travel my own becuse of several reasons.

Firstly, when you travel with a group led by tour guide you must fallow them all your travel. It sounds do not come me good. It seems very resricted and boring. Before you travel to some places sometimes you make some search about this place anda you imagine something also you plan something. When you travel with a group if a tour guide will plan to see places , where you plan to see , it is a  problem.  Addtion to this, you can be bored the place but because of the group you must be in there. So it is not a good situtaion.

Secondly, tour guides generally take you historical places. Sometimes it is a good but for person who is not interested with history or art it is also bad situtaion.

In conclusion there are many reason like these to prefer travel my own. Tour may not be good as you espected. The hotel may not be clear or comfortable. Altough there are some advantages of travalling   with a group led by a tour guide,
