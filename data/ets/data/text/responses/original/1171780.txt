There are discussion that in the future, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Although some people thinks that using the car increase than nowadays. Because they think that the car is the most thing to not improve and they don't have side-effects. But I think that there will be decrease in using the car in the future. There are several reasons. 
      
       First, Nowadays, there is problem that oil, gas is reduce because of unplanned excavation. So it cause to lack of oil to move. It means that although we have a lot of cars, we cannot drive because there is no oil to move. Therefore we need to other substitute oil or alternating method for movements. I think that find alternating methods for movements outweigh to find other oil. 
     
      Second, The car cause pollution of air. Actually  the car produce CO2, NOx. It increase earth's temperature. So, the height of sea is increase. Maybe our lands will be under the water. Imagine that condition you don't have land to plant and to live in. From these problem, many human is studying to find other method to move that it is not cause to pollute the air. 
    
       Third, the car is unconvenient. Because it can not only out of order frequently but also can't cross the other continent. Nowadays, there is global world. So to increase the power of nation, we should invent free-cross continents like ship and planes to trade easily.
   
       For these above mentioned reasons, there is no doubt in my mind that there will be fewer cars in use, in the future. Because it cause air pollution and gradually the oil is reduced.
