Within the following essay I discuss if people trying new things and taking more risks are more succesful than people using well established practices. 

For the beginning I give an principal definition of succes, because it is a question of perspective wether someone is succesful or not. Secondly I highlight several arguments on the topic before concluding with my own opinion on it. 

Succes is within a society normally a well conscructed and established value. Every value consists normally of an imagination of distinctive goals. Instead succes itself is not adequate to a constructed goal but needs to be constructed by each community of people. Within Western countries who share the same principles of economy and society succes can be defined as earning a lot of money, having a family or simply being happy, whatever this would say. Now my perspective focusses on the economic perspective by earning a lot of money and therefore I definite succes by it.

By stretching the economic face of succes I need to differentiate between new products and well established products. New products are normally accompagnied by a bigger amount of risks and also by a larger scale of innovativity than established products are. The example of franchising worked on earlier this TOEFL fits quite well. It is relatively easy to buy the right of a huge company like Burger King and to produce its products but it also highlights the limitations of own freedom to establish something own. While starting his proper buisness is relatively costly for oneself and is followed by the incertainity of acceptance of the product, it lets some room for creativity and personality. Additionally new innovative products could be sold for higher price.
Nevertheless it couldn't be denied that you can earn money with both possibilities. Perhaps it's not really a question of succes in this case, but of making it a special way.  

For my conclusion I emphasize on the hope of everyone to have succes that leads people to start something new and innovative against all odds. This hope might be imaginative but leads researchers to new inventions and at all humanity to progress. So it would be necessary for humanity but not for economic succes at a short range. By using well established practices you can suceed too and by stretching on the example of new products you need an etablished name to sell products better. 

Therefore it's the mixture of both, risk and new ways as well as well established  ways that leads to overall success, for individuals, enterprises and humanity.
