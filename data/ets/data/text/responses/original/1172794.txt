The students' teaching method is very controversive between the approach focused on the facts and the other more based on the concepts and the ideas. I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for three main reasons : understanding ideas can help the student to understant facts, it is easier to learn facts individually, understanding ideas allow the student to develop its own reflexion and criticism.

Firstly it seems to me than when a student understands ideas and concepts than will help it to understand the facts. Indeed it would be not very interesting for a student to learn a succesion of facts without knowing why these facts are happening. For example the history facts are numerous and it is impossible to keep all of them but if you understand the ideas of an special historical event you can learn better all the facts that are associated with this event.

Secondly I think that it is easier to learn the facts individually than understand ideas and concepts. As a matter of fact, the professor can give to their students keys that will help them to understand the idea. At the contrary the facts are not difficult to understand and also the support of the professor is not indispensable. The professor can illustrate the facts with personal experiences and therefore making them more interesting but he will not change the facts. 

Finally, I believe that the understanding of ideas and concepts for a student is the basis of the development of its own reflexions and also to have criticism. By identifying the structure of a conceptor a idea, the student can develop its own ideas and build also a thinking system. For instance a student that understand well a special philosophy concept can do its own theory about the concept.

To conclude I can say that the understanding of ideas and concepts is the most important part of a student learning process, even if it is not unnecessary to learn facts but not as the first priority.
