    Nowaday, ours family is going to smaller than what we have before. A hundred of years before we have a huge family. It contain more than 6 people in it. Each member have their onw duty for big family. They work together for communitiy - familiy. However, we only have 3 or 4 members in one familiy. I agree with. I agree tha young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping theur communitiy They are not learned  by older people that what they can do for communuty. They are so busy now.
     First of all, young people can't find old people to teach them what thay can do for community. I beliave house-teaching, helping their commununity, is very important to young people. Old people usually teach them to young people. Nowaday, we are living seperate with old people. Young people do not have chance to learne what they should do.
     Nextly, they are too busy to help their commonity. They are having very busy day, even do not have a time for take rest. After school done, extra educate insitidutions are waiting them, They are staying at the educate insititutons most of day time.  For example, my young sister who only age 14, she has 2 extra study after school done and come bace aroung 10:00. She does't even have a chance to envolve in her community. 
   In conclusion, i  agree whth young people have
