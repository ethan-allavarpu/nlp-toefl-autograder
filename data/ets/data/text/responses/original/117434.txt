	At first glance, we may think that speacilazing in one subject is good for us as we can concentrate all our time and energy on just one subject. But having this kind of strategy might prevent us from to complete our necessary improvement.
	Firstly, all kinds of sciences have complex structures that no specific subject can be thought to be completely independent from other academic subjects. Having no knowledge about other academic subjects is something that will always limit us during our studies. For instance, a computer scientist like me may never need information about sciences like physics or chemistry during university studies. But if on one day, I need to create a software for a company that produce chemical products, I will need asistance from other people for everything that is related to chemistry. From the projects I have made for the industry, I realized that having some knowledge about every topic really helps. In fact, a computer engineer can not be seen as a real engineer, if he does not even have basic concepts of general engineering principles. He will always will be incomplete and in need of help from other people. 
	In addition, as far as I learned from the software industry, having broad knowledge of many subjects is something that seperates you from other people in the same area and makes you chosen instead of others. If we really want to be good in our jobs, this can not be succeeded by just concentrating on one subject. 
	Another fact is that there are so many interesting academic subjects in the science. We may be happy if we can have spend some time on some other subject and improve ourselves. It is not a good thing to limit ourselves to just one subject all the time as there might be lots of topics that might be interesting for us.
	In conclusion, I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. As we have time and resources to get knowledge about many academic subjects during our university studies, we should try to get familiar with the highest number of academic subjects and we should not limit ourselves to just one top .
