I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help the communities. In many organizations and foundations, there are a lot of young people working to help the communities. A lot of schools also require students to do community service. Sometimes doing community service is a relax for us. We young people do want to get involve in the communities. 
           Community service is required by most of the schools in United States. Students are required to do amount of hours whether they like it or not. By doing community service, students help in theirt communities and make time for the communities because they need to finish their community service requirement in order to pass the grade. Some school will also give out honors to those who work over the requirement. We students will work harder and give out more hours to the communities to gain those honors. Even though some studnets are not willing to do the community service, they still give out a lot of time to the communities because of the requirement. 
           A lot of young people give out their time to the communities to relax and get way from their school work. A lot of time students, including me, are tired of the school work and materials and want relax. I found helping the communities allows me to relax and not think about my work. At the same time, I'm using my relaxing time to help my commuity and the people who need my help. It is benefitial to both my community and myself. 
         In conclusion, Young people nowadays do give enough time to help their communities in many way. Whether we young people do communities service for the school requirement or to relax from school work, we are giving time and energy to our communities and to get involve in the communities.
