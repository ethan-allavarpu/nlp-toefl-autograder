In my personal opinion young people do not spend enough time helping their communities when it is needed. Our personal goals focus on ourselves whereas others generation's goals focused on community. there may be many reasons why this change came upon us, however, I guess the most important one is related to this our new style of life. Our way of life push us to worry about personal things rather than global ones. We care about our personal image, our personal grants and our personal skills. We have to. However we must try to change and we ought to realize what it is happening outside and in fact we should give our helping hand.Anyway, I think young people are no blame of this kind of selfishness but they are unaware. 

First of all, we have adquire a new way of life. We do live comfortable. Our parents usually provide us everything we need. Everywhere it seems as if nobody needs anything from us as long. Our community is rich and everyone can reach a good position as long as this person works. Thus, our goal is not related to our community in which everything runs "perfectly well" but it is focused in ourselves. Our own complains and artificial needs are highlighted. We have to be perfect not just good, but perfect. We have to worry about such things in order to survived in this "ideal community".
Inasmuch as we are so worried about ourselves we are not able to see the problems our community has, we are not aware of that.

Regarding this lack of awareness we can explain why we do not help but we can not avoid trying people realize their selfishness. We have to take a look over our reality. We must do more for our community than we are doing up to now. It is a good chance not only for the community but for us to grow
