Since many years and among the history of the Humanity, the use of the car as always being important and in some cases indispensable. Nowadays, the situation is changing and we are face to a problem : do we still have to use our car while many factors influence us to use others solutions or to use less the car? In my opinion, I would rather say that in twenty there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

First of all, it is important to remind the actual situation on earth. The cost of gas is extremely high and more than before. We can also say that it might continue to grow for many years. Why? To serve interest of the governments and powerful people who lead nations or corporations. I think that people know that the gas' price is too expensive and will continue to increase year after year. Moreover, it is relevant to say that the car' cost is as much expensive as the gas'cost. In fact, today, if we want to buy a new car it costs a lot of money and in many cases, some families need to borrow money to get one. It is becoming a luxury product. It is useful to say that households are bored of this important growth. They would like to find other solutions in order to avoid taking their car.

Then, one of the most important thing in our society today is the protection of the environment. How many households would stop using their car and find other way of transportation in order to "save the earth"? A lot. I think so. The pollution due to the gas, the problems encountered with the forests all around the world become more and more familiar to the population. And I really think that people feel more and more concerned by that. By the way, it is important to notice that since a few months, we can assist to the development of a new form of transportation such as the commom transports (bus, train) and the come back of the bicycles in the big cities for example. In my opinion, the best example to prove that is the city of Berlin. In fact, I was impressed when I went over there for the first time, because we can see bicycles everywhere around us and people tend to use those new forms of transportation more and more. I really like this idea which spreads out in many cities today.

Finally, we can say that the motivation of being a good citizen, the increase of the costs of the gas and the cars, will hopefully help people using less and less their car and prefer bicycles or common transports. I really believe that in twenty years, people will find others ways to go from a place to another. It depends on many factors but one of the most important is the motivation. I hope that people will take these piece of information into account in oder to change the future and learn how to use less the car.
