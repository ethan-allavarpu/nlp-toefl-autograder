We all are interested in reading about cars and dream of owning a car. It is one of the first few items that we plan to buy if someone asks us what we would do if we win a lottery ? If we observe the recent trend in car manufacturing, the demand for cars is ever growing. I dont think there is any chance that people will stop using cars in years to come. Infact I feel that in twenty more years, this craze of buying a car is going to multiply even further and there will be more cars in use than there are today. 

Twenty years is a very less time span to let go off a luxury like owning a car. Owning a car has become a status symbol. People want to own a car just beacuse it improves their standing in the society. In less developed countries, the level of noise and air pollution created by the use cars is unbeleivable. Laws and regulations have little effect on the demand for cars in these countries. 

Car manufacturing industry is a huge industry with a turn over of millions of dollars per month all over the world. Who would possibly give up such a profitable business ? Instead we are going to see more number of new and new cars & more number of commercials attracting people to buy these cars in coming years.

People are not going to stop using cars overnight. So many factors come into play when we talk about not using cars. The governments will have to improve the public transport to a level wherein people will prefer travelling by public commute rather than using a car. That looks like a distant possibility in some nations.

 Modern technology has invaded our lives to a level where man finds it difficult to survive without it. Cars, cellfones, television sets, music systems, washing machines, refrigerators and other such things have become a part of our life. We cannot think about living a life which lacks in the comforts given by these modern machines. Car is just one of the many things man has created for his own comfort. 

Man has failed to realise that these machines are causing more harm than their known uses. These modern machines have ruined our earth's atmosphere and oneday will lead us to extinction. If we want to survive, we will have to take one big step towards minimising the use of these machines specailly cars that cause so much of pollution.
