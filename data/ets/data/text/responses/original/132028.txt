Although it would be a good thing for the environment if there were fewer cars in the future, I do not think this will happen. Three arguments convince me that there will be even more cars in the near future.

In the first place, most of us rely on their car to easily go to every place whenever it may be desireable. I am sure that no one will change this behaviour, unless he or she is forced to do so. I do not think everyone will suddenly use the bus or the train, because most of us would feel as if their mobility or personal right to move were restricted. Therefore, there will not be fewer cars within 20 years.

Additionally, the number of cars is a global affair. I recently read an article about the emerging state in the far east, which mentioned the fact that people in countries like China are about to having gathered enough wealth to afford cars. Imagine a billion persons from this region, who suddenly drive a car! So, even if the developed countries would reduce their reliance on cars, the number of cars would actually increase.

Quite on the contrary, one might argue that global society will have no choice but to use fewer cars in the future because of a shortage of oil. But I think that mankind will finally overcome this concern, at least when it is forced to do so, by using alternative energy. These technologies are already available today, but are not being used extensively for several reasons. Eventually, when cheap oil is now longer available, car producers will switch, because of the peoples' reliance mentioned earlier. Consequently, the number of cars will not drop significantly.

In conclusion, I predict that the number of cars will rise instead of decline. I would feel a lot better with that, if people would take more care of their environment and use green cars today, even if they are a bit more expensive.
