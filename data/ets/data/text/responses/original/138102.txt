      `In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.` I don't agree with this statement for many reasons. The first one is that there is an important car culture in most of our societies today. The second one is the development of new technologies which will have a big impact on the use of cars.
       First, the car culture is something very developed today. In many societies , the car is the symbol of many things. For example, on the social aspect, it's really important to own a car. The more it's big and expensive, the more you show your high social status. Moreover, for teenagers, the first car is very important : you want to show everybody that you know how to drive, that you have a car,...In fact, you just want to show that you are becoming an adult. Another reason of this car culture is that taking your car is really easier than taking any other means of transport. You can take it when you want and you don't fear to be late. Moreover, many cities don't have enough effective means of transport such as buses or subways and you are obligated to take your car. 
       The second reason why I would never agree with this statement is the development of new technologies. First, new health technologies allow people to live better and later than before. That's a reason why the population is going to grow rapidly and own more cars. Moreover, some countries are also growing economically so that their population will bewcome wealthier and will be able to afford a car. Another fact is that there is beginning to have a lack in the petroleum resources of the earth. However, with the development of new renewable sources of energies to make the cars functionning, it will not lead to a decreasing of the number of cars.
         These are the reasons why I don't think that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today. However, I hope this statement will become true because the problem of the pollution has to be taken seriously. In the bottom line, I would say that, if we don't find solutions quickly to this problem, this statement will never be true and this will very harmful for our planet.
