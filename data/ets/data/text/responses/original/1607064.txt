  I agree with the statement.  Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.  In my opinion, there are several reasons about this.

  The first reason that young people nowadays don`t give the time to helping their communities.  I think that young people don`t try to communicate with people who lives in near them.  Young people tend to stay in their house or they are go out from house.  But it is not only young people.  Nowadays people don`t often join the communities.  And people don`t communicate with each other agglessive.  

  A second reason that young people don`t give the time to helping their communities.  They use their time for themself not for their communities.  They use the time for themself than they use for their communities.  Because it is age that people priority identity now. 

  Lastly,  why the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.  There are no advantages if young people give time to helping their communities.  So they don`t feel requirement to give time to helping their communities.  

  Nowadays young people tend to avoid communicate with people near them.  People will be more isolated from communities.  That is why, young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping their communities.
