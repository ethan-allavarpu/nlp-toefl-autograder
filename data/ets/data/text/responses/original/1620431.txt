As a journalism student, I think that it's more important learn the facts than anything else, so i'm totally disagree with the statement. I can't understand how can be possible that you can learn and appreciate more the ideas or the concepts than the fact itself. 
You don't think is better evaluate and re-evaluate the fact and then establish your own ideas? In my opinion, learning concepts and ideas, is learning what other people learned about the fact. Using others as a referencial group isn't bad or wrong. But the point is that learning facts makes you responsable for whatever you learned. In other words you just didn't follow anothers opinions, anothers concepts or ideas. You create your owns, and if they're wrong, then YOU evaluate your own concepts or ideas. 
Precisely, is more objective the fact itself. Think of this: if you learned first the idea or concept, in some way you already know something and just stay in that line, but if you go directly to the fact you can have your own knowledge...Created by you.
