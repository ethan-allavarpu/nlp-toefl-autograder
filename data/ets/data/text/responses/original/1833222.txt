It is often being said that older people don't take advantage of life as much as we, youngsters, do. Well, you cannot deny that, when you reach a certain age, you can no longer do things you used to do when you were in your sweet sixteens. As a matter of fact, I am quite sure every single person has, at least once in his or her life,  already heard an old person say bitterly: "Oh, what I wouldn't do if I were your age !" Is that to mean that life isn't worth living when growing old? I shall refute this statement, by showing that older people enjoy life in a different manner, compared to youngsters. 

Firstly, I have to say that, when you are growing older and when your health is getting worse,  it is very understandable that you are no longer attracted by doing the "crazy things" young people are nowadays so keen on, you were maybe used to do when you were young. Enjoying life is not only about going to discotheques every night, experimenting new things such as taking drogues and so on and so forth. It is true that enjoying life doesn't only rely on extreme activities, and one shouldn't understimate the fact that old people may be not able to do the simplest things, such as going for a ride on a bike, and they may be suffering from this. Yet, I think that older people don't enjoy their life the same way the youngsters do, they just enjoy it differently.

That is why I don't think that older people are not bound to live with their memories and it is a mistake to think that they are not able to enjoy life. When you reach a certain age, you get to appreciate other things, such as tranquillity, family, all the thingsthings that you weren't able to take fully advantage of when you were young, mainly because of your job being too demanding and to time-taking.

As a result, all depends on the definition you make out of the expression "enjoying life". If you define it as enjoying the most crazy things of life, then, no, the elderly doesn't enjoy life. But if you define it as taking profit of each of the raptures life can give, then, yes, the age is not an obstacle.
