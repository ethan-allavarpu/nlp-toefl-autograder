Yes, this right. Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, because most products think they are better than the other. Like two people play a game,some times, the loser will think the winner doesn't better than him, just because he was lack. Even the winner win the game so easy, the loser think the winner just same leavel to himself. So they always think themself is better, so they wouldn't listen to any body. They think they are always ture, becaues they are better than the other.
