	If you were successful in doing some thing I daut that you want to do a nother thing to be successful. The people who are called successful are roten people they falo a sertin way and don't do new things , they don't think a lot about difrint ways they just focice on perfecting the things they do there way and if they were tring new things they won't be successful.

	If you knew a successful percon you'd find that he is don'ing every thing he writs for him self you dont see him doing new things or trying new ways in sted he'l stic on his own way to be succesful.

	Successful people don't try to do some thing difrent because they are afred and taryfid that thy wont be successful and there is nothig wrong with that but still they don't do som thing new they just stic with wat they have in sted.
