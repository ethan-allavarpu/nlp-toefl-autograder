in the future there will be fewer cars in use, i think. Today,  buying a car is more possible than in the past. because it is cheaper and more essential for people. however, while the time is going on, the roads have been crowded and traffic problems have increased. therefore people's complicates have raised. now, there are no adequate roads. the government may build more roads so that provide the translation. on the other hand, there are so many roads that building new ones may not be possible one day. to illustrate the government may be increased the saling prices of cars and buying a new car may be difficult. i think this idea should support and the people should encourage to go somewhere with the governments busses. moreover, going anywhere with the busses is cheaper than the fact that we go with. the population in turkey is also a factor of increasing the number of cars. while a number of person is increasing, these crowded roads and traffic problems will increase. to sum up, the government should provide  the using of cars to be decreased.
