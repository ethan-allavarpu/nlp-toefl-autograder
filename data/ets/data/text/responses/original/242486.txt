 	I disagree intwenty yeats there will be more cars in use than there ae today. In moderen countrys such as japan they still use cara even they have new modren metroos and transption> Aslo yung guyts like to putt it in accation mostly so they like to drive not driven or buy using some sort of new teghnalge that don't have.

	In countrys such Saudi Arebia where i am from. we still do'nt have metrroes so idon't think that cars will be fewer use of it. becuse it takes a long time to make roads for metteroes and lines btween citys. so not in twenty years don't think so .

 	cars have alot of use so if they goning to replce cars with some new thing its not gioing to take twenty years it will take more that. so people will still use cars i htink not just for the in twenty five or mybe more than that . also company that amkes cars are going like a wind i nthe market of cars peaople are  wating for the newer in ever year so the butter car looked from how strong or the shaepd of it the size people will still have to buy it. so ithink big compny are  aware if in twent years that if people stop using cars somthin would came up.

	I iwoul say the will be more cars use then ever in that past that for a fact becuse people will be more  than naw. So don't think  about beening fewer cars in use inthe feture. there no picter for the feture what we use to redose the use of cars i mean think about going to skool with what using a bus or mettro no way  not good at all .
