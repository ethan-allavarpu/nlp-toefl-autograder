      Since the first car was used by people,people always want to have a fewer car so that the goals of the car factories are giving to people what they want.Engineers studied to developed the models especially they specialized about the motor.They innovated more  powerful motor than the previous ones.
      Today, the improvements about the motor are going on speedly. Technology gives support to this studies.The cars are more faster than the old cars but it is not only one criter about the cars. The view is another criter, so cars are not only developed as their motor but also they are developed as their shapes.Especially after increasing the number of women driving cars the scape and colour is more important because of their esthetic opinion.
       Besides, security is a common subject when a car is evaluated.
When traffic was occured in big cities because of increasing of population, unfortunately big car accidents begun to happen commonly so another criteria is determined : A car must be safety.
So the suspancion systems was found and even they are developed today and also seat belts became a standard for the cars.
       The reason why I mention the whole developments is making a comparety between todays cars and the old cars.According to many people cars which are produced in twenty years are most esthetic      than the others but if we compare their quality, Today's cars are most powerful and security and accoding to me more beautiful.This is the exact thing what people wants.Everything is devloped in a huge speed, the cars can not be remained same.They must be changed and they must be more efficent
