In twenty years there wull be fewer cars in use tjan there are today.As far as I am concerned.I disagree with the statement because I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is a good .The cars is a important in we life.We used cars is many years.Cars give we have a quitly.

First of all the many people have a car,and many people have naad car go to doing everything. For example we have by car take to a trip.Moreover the car can give we go to diffirence trip.Give we have have a good trip funny
.

In addition the porson have a car. Theyself can have a time.Everytime go to there is Ok.For instance many porson go to school they can weting the bus.Furthermore have a car not weting the bus.Weting the bus is hot so good.

In summary I think have a cars have a good time give myself.I can go to everything.Go to a trip with my perence togater. Furthermore have a car not weight bus.SO I disagree with the statemant In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
