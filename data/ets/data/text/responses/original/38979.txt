I never think about this argument before. I hope that the phrase in bold at the left of monitor are true, but I don't know if this will be in the future. I am only twentythree years old and twenty years are a lot of time for me, and so in this period will happen.  My dream is live in a world wirh fewer cars, because i think we can do everything with public transport or bike. Now I live in Milan the one of biggest town in Europe and I always can move to one part to other part of the town by my bike, so I think most of population of cities can do it. If is immpossible moving by bike i thin k that we can take an autobus or other  pubblic transport moving i nhe cities. Another example of this argume is the China. In this country the most of population moves by bike. This is important in my opinion and this kind to move can permit a world with fewer cars. I think that cars are a good meads of trasport for the travel and a good logistic solution. Some years ago i was in Spain for a trip with my four friends, and with them I went all spain alog by car. This was good expierence for me and so in my opinion in releted cases the cars are allow. Another aspect where the cars or simila meands of transport are necessary is to solve the important logistic problems like the transport medicines, illness people or for emergency cases like a fire disasters. In conclusion I hope the number of cars decrease immediatly, day by day, so when I will be adults there will be fewer cars in the world.
