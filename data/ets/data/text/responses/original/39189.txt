i agree because, cause their success, some egocentric people think that they can do everything, and without experience, they take experiments in other sectors. This approach it cuold be dangerous because if people don't plan their business, they could have financial problem caused  by activities' hazzard. 
However many succesfully-business people must try new things and take risks because the business sectors continually evolved and if you haven't avanguardian tecnologies for the production and always new ideas to throw on the market, it could happen that you must close your activity.
Taking risks is an aspect that many economiests studies, because risk has a stimulative effect, so if  worker feels stimulated himself he produces better. With this conception succesfull people take often risks so they feel to have more responsabilities than normal people and also they feel stimulated themeselves to do better and better.
taking risks is a conseguence of the "free deal"
