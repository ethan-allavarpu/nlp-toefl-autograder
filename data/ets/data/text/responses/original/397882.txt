   I do not think that there will be fewer cars in  use than there are today. There are two main reasons to support my oppinions.
  When people thnk about future of the car , many of they might be think about the oil problem. Actually oil price is geeting higher and higher in theses days and some analysits say that all the oil we have now  will be gone next  50 years.  But  we can not ignore about ability of the new technology.  Not only Japanse car company but also all of the world company are fascinating to creat new car which is not depend on oil enagy. Soura cars and car running by the power of Hydrogion.  And aols  new enagy is realized now. For example in Brazil they get the enagy from the plants.
   Other reason is that  we are so depend on car life. Weuse car every day. We can't live without car. Especially United States, country is too learge so that other trnsportation is not be devepoed enough. In Jaapan people are also depend on car life.To tell the truth, legs of humans are cars. So we will never be able to say good bay to the car.
      I think it's sad thing that we are so depend on car life.But I also think we can creat much better car to us and to the environment after twenty years. So that I think there will be not fewer cars in use than there are today. I think it can be increased.
