An education system should be capable of giving to the students all the elements in order to be a better persons and professionals. Obviusly, understanding ideas and concepts is very important for the students for learnig and analize things, but I think that is not enough.
Students should have all the elements in order to resolve problems and face conflicts in the future.
Learning specifics facts, like history facts or gramar facts, is important, but is not the only way to get a complete education. The specific facts, students learn them for the exam and forget next day, but if the teachers teach them how to connect ideas, how to understand concepts, how to make a connection between this with that, students will have the elements to be a sucesfull people.
An student can know everything about history or maths or maybe chemistry, buy if he can't make a logical conexion between facts and ideas, it doesn't  make any sense.
When students have to face on working expirience, they won't need specifical facts that they learn in school, they will need the capacity of conecting ideas and understanding concepts.
The last sentence doesn't mean that facts, as dates or formulas or specifics things, students doesn't need them in working life, probably will probably won't, but I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more valuable for a company when they want a good employer.
Students needs an education that provides them a lot of elements to resolve problems, create ideas, connect concepts and anything can help them to be a person who can face any problem or situation succesfully.
