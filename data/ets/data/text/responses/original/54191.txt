	What will be the future of car ussage? People like travelling with cars, even the destination is near to their locations, and the car industry always pushes the use of cars with different kinds beatiful cars. At this point, what if I claim that in twenty year there will be fewer cars? Are you suprised?
	Yes, I claim that the usage of car will be decreased! There will be two reasons for this decrease. First one will be the restrictions of governments due to state planing and avoiding pollution. If you have a car, you may probably facing with the parking problem. If there were less number of cars in use, that was not be a problem for us today. Besides the parking problem, the time wasted in traffic jam will make governments to restrict to use of cars. The third thing that will push the governments to restrict this usage will be the raise of air pollution due to cars. What will be the solutions provided by them? There are two thing that can be done. One of them is to allowing at most one car per citizen. The other is allowing some cars in some days; for example, allowing just the even numbered car plates in the even numbers of months.
	Besides the restriction of the government, the health problems will make people use their cars less. Today, the foods with huge amount of calories can be easily accessible and most of the job holders are white colored. This means that most of the people have to do something to lose the weights comming from all the time sitting and consuming foods with much calories. Of course, the best thing to do is doing sport. But this time may not available to everyone. So, it is better to use cars and walk at least for the near destinations.
	In conclusion, in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use due to two facts. One of them will be the restrictions of governments due to state governing and planning, and the other reason will be the health problems of people. These causes will force people to use their cars less.
