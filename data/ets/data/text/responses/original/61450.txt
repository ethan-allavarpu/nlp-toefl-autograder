	In these days, there are numerous problems which are related with cars, such as air pollution problems, traffic jams, or fuel problems. I strongly believe that these problems will be solved as the numbers of cars decrease in next twenty years, with the changes of the government policy and developments of new technology. 
 	First, government tries to make a policy to decrease numbers of cars, as they face with the problems which are caused by cars.

	Second, new technologies develop to substitute cars, such  as monorails, private air crafts, and these equipments will be practical immediately. There have been many researches to create  new transportation which is better than car, and finally these days, these efforts are gaining their results. For example, many scientists have tried to make air crafts which can be used in common places, because the air crafts are more energy efficient and pollution free than cars in these days. About two years from now, they succeeded in the development, and according to some newspapers,  it will be practical in ten years from then. 
	In brief, cars are the main transportation equipment in these days, but it will be decreased as the government policies change and new technologies develop. Even though we can not think of our lives without cars in theseday, our children or grand children will think it's o
