  I agree with the idea that young people don't give enough time to helping thier communities. The young around me participate in the traditional ceremony and activity at least. However, the number of the young whe are involved with such kind of activity is not so many.
   My friends engaged in the protecting the traditional dance and ceremony even though they were not born in the city, and they build the good relationship with local people. I heard local people admire the attitude and pasion toward the event. I was moved to hear hat, but most young don't have time to engage in it because they have what they have to do before helping thier communities. For example, they have to study and work as a part time job.Therefore, they don't have enough time to participating in it even though they are interested in activity.  A friend of mine said that she wanted to take part in the activity that they can play with local school children, but she can't do that because of lack of time and large amount of homework.
   Second, the adults are also negative for the social activity. For example, some parents don't allow thier children to communicate with neighbors, and they grow up thier children in that way, as a result, they can't help growing without knowing the system of community. Since I was born in the community where the relationship among the communities was strong, so I could participated in many activities. However, the people who was born in urban area haven't experienced activity. I guess if the young, who haven't experienced the activity and been taught the importance of relationship among the communitiys, grow up, the number of involvement with the activity would decrease more and more.  
   We can learn a lot of thing from community activity, so we shoud take part in it and the adult shoud teach the importance.
