I agree with this idea. Because, I think for be successful people They need  have confidence themself decision and think. So, I think if, people who scared of risk or don't want to take risk. That kind  person can't be successful people.Because,I think  this word is realistic and useful for this world "No risk No return." "High risk High return."

Successful people they have confidence themselves. So, they can creat new thing and they can try to new thing. If people don't have confidence themselves, they can't creat anything.how they even can try new thing. That mean is they even can take a risk. 

If, people feel satisfy and they tend to defence itself about sociallity position and money. According that word " No risk No return" I think they just will lose money and position. If people feel satisfaction about their potision and money, they don't want do anything without difende themselves. People gearn money from their move. Even smart people or people who don't have any creer and skills, they can't earn money without move.So, simply People who only do defence, they can't earn money. Although, they need money for defence themselves.
