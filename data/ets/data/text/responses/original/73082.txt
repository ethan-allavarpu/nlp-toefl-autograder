Cars have been vey important since they were important.  At the first time not many people could afford it, but now most of the population owns, unless, one. However, in the last years we have been told many bad news about the enviroment. Cars consume petrol and then it burns in order to make the car works. The result of this activity affects a lot to the atmosphere. The Ultraviolet rays are entering in our sistem, crossing all the covers of the atmosphere. The enviroment is very polluted, and as a result of this animals are desapearing.

Anyway, cars help in this situation as well as the human being action. In the news they recomend us to take the bus in spite of driving everybody their cars. If that idea works the enviroment would improve. Besides, animals aren't the only ones that are affected, humans can suffer many injuries, for example problems when they breath or even it can be seriouly affected to the sight. Moreover, blocks of flats are part of the problem of polltion, many houses look dirty what that's a consequence of the pollution.

From my point of view I think that if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today that means that people will start to take care of the enviroment. Not using the car constantly as much as we do now implies less pollution. 

Although cars not only affect to atmosphere with the pollution. There are so many reasons why I agree with the statement. Cars are very noise and much if they are in a traffic jam and they are in a hurry. When they start shouting to each other. That's not good for the people who is every day hearing this unconfortable noises. In a long time this can causes many health problems such as stress or even heart problems.

Finally, I woludn't like to forget saying that the less cars in use are in the streets the more bus drivers will be, that means that there will we less unemployed people.
