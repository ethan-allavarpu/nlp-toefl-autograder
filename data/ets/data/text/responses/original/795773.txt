  I completely agree with the statement  " Young people  enjoy life more than older people". Young people have different type of thinkings and always the mind of young people is wandering  all over the world  whereas the olderpeople doesn't think more because as they think of their life,family and children
                   Firstly, younger people have different types of ideas and thinkings in mind they always want to be cheerful ,they enjoy alife lot  and they doesn't think much about family.There will be no limitations
for the younger people and they achieve every thing always they want to be whereas older people  will have limitations.For example if a young person want to do a stunt he will recklessly do it he doesn't think about the next situation what is going to be happened whereas old person will think of it to do stunt  and some times he will egt apanic to do it .Young people will have a lot dreams which can be achievable wheres the dreams of older people cannot be achievable sometimes.
                    Secomdly  Young people  will enjoy a life lot with no limitations in the world and behaves like a freebird whereas older people can't behave like that due to their age and health problems.
For example young person wants to dance  and he will do it with out any hesitation wheras older people won't dance as that of young people dueto their age and thinking of their health.Even in Food point of view also younger people can eat each and every thing but older peoeple can't
                     Young people  have a lot of dreams and can fulfil their dreams but old people can"t fulfil their dreams at sometime.suppose if  a21 yearold person want to invent spacecraft he can invent it  but wheras 81 year old can't due to his age.so from point of view always young people enjoy life more than old people
