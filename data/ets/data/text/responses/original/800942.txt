	Every person should enjoy their life as much as they can.  The life is not long, and it will end.  So shouldn't we enjoy our lives when we are young?  I disagree the statement, and I think older people enjoy life more than young people do.  
	First, older people usually have more money than young people do.  When you have money, you have the power.  Money is everything.  Although sometimes people say money can't buy happiness, without money you can't do anything.  Old people can use these amoung of money to travel everywhere around the world, and buy anything they want.  In th other hand, young people start to find a perfect job.  The power in them are not much.
	Second, older people usually have family, which is the happiest place to be.  When they see their childern grow up, they enjoy that happiness.  When they have the grandchildren, the happiness become more.  Old people have their own family to hang out with, they share everything everyday.  But young people don't stick around the house very often.  They want to play, and they don't want to be controled.  Although they are happy with their friends, not with parents.  They'll miss that.
	Final, older people have more time than young people do.  Old people don't worry about the work because maybe they are already retired, or they already have the position in the company.  They can relax as much as they want without worrying their job.  But young people have to work hard everyday and try to improve themselves to their boss.  They try to find the mate, but they are too busy to find.  Young people can't enjoy themselves because they always have the pressure in mind. 
	I am a young people now, and I try to balance my school and relax time.  I can't say I am enjoying the life right now because I haven't get my goal yet.  I want to be successful, and then having fun.
I realize that the only way to enjoy the life is working hard as a young people and playing hard as a old people.
