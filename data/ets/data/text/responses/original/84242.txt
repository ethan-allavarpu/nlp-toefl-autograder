Yes. I agree that in the near future the number of cars that are in use will be lesser than that of today's car count.

The first reason for my agreement with the statement is that the world's economy is growing at a faster rate and technological innovations are immanent within the system. This might result in an efficient , cost-effective, superfast railway network which connencts an urban area like a labyrinth. The main emphasis is given to urban ares in the previous statement because they are the ones that have more number of cars than the rural areas usually do. The state-of-art technology might drive the communers to use the railways as an alternative to using cars. This might lead to less number of cars in next twenty years.

There is a general concern over environmental pollution especially on air pollution. The main contributor to this air pollution is the smoke produced from the exhaust of the car engines. The awareness toward this pollution might reach all the citizens of the urban areas and make them realize the importance to reduce the pollution. As a result they might seek alterantive means of transport apart from cars.
Consequently this awareness might urge the citizens not to use cars in the near future.

One of the major concerns in the modern society is the cost of the petroleum or gas. It is so high that people are hesitating to use cars even now. As the natural resources of the earth are limited and the use of oil consumption has been very high despite its cost, the situation in twenty years could be marked by lack of enough oil for transporation. Obvioulsy this would inhibit people from using the cars if there are no other alternative fuels for cars.

In twenty years an exotic, efficient and impressive machine might be invented. As humanbeings, who always want to try out something new, would feel prestigious if they were possessed with that exotic, impressive machine. Again this might lead to decrease in number of cars in twenty years.
