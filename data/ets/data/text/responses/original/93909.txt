A day will come when there will be no automobiles because of the pollution they cause and the depletion of the fuel resources.I totally agree with the topic that in 20 years there will be no cars unless some major action is taken by the government to reduce the polution that is caused by the cars.
                                         Man invented car thinking that he would help the fellow beings in using easy means of the transport but,he never thought about the consequences that the planet earth might face due to excess usage of cars.
                            Initially, cars were actually used by the rich because it was costly.But nowadays cars are available at affordable prices and are available in a wide range so this has resulted in excess usage of cars.
                               Firstly,The problems caused by the usage of cars and thier effects are humangus.The car drinks fuel to run so there is a need for excavation of fuel resources in the earth which has resulted in soil erosion,land sliding and depletion of the natural resources.so unless a method to conserve these resouces are adopted the cars may not be able to get the fuel to run in the future.
                                     Secondly,Another major problem caused by cars are the pollution they create when their engine uses fuel for combustion and gives out highly dangerous exhaust gas which results in ozone layer depletion.As a result of this we are facing the problem of global warming.
                                 The solution to this is now being majorly thought about.New Hybrid cars are being designed so that they make use of less fuel.Cars driven by electricity and Fuel cells(Water) are in a devoloping stage so that they reduce the pollution caused by their engines.
                     Only if these problems of using cars are awnsered with good solutions,the next generation can enjoy the thrill of traveling in a car.I would like to take my children 20 years down the line in a car which is100 percent pollution free.Hope this happens!
