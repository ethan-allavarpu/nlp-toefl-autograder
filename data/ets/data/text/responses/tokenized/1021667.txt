It has been an argument regarding with the issue that , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Some people prefer to travel alone .
Because they do n't need to adjust their time for the other people and they can decide everything by themselves .
However , on my perspective , I think it is better to travel by a group led by a tour guide rather than traveling alone .

First , If we travel to the place that we are not familiare , everything is so srange .
So in this case we need somewone who are well known about the place , like a tour guide .
It is certain that tour guide is an expert of the travel place , He or she will make a great scedule and adjust the time .
The only thing that we have to do is following the schedule .
I think It is convinient and we do n't need to waste the time .

Second , we can have more great experience with the group of people .
People can exchange theire own opinion and also they can take a remarkable picture together .
They can also enjoy more pleasure time rather than feeling alon .
As people are living the social sociaty , travelling by a group could help to develope theire relationship

Finally , because of two reason , I think better and efficient way to travel is tarvelling in a group of people together led by a tour guide .
