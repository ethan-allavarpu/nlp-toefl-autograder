It is interesting to travel and to know about culture of other countries .
When I travel , I usually travel with a tour guide .
I become more pleased after I go traveling in a group than traveling freely .
I strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because , I can get knowledge and I can spend travel money more effectively .

To begin , I can get knowledge .
One of tour guides ' work is to help people to understand the culture of the other countries .
Also they need to make sure that they show the culture and some tourists give opportunities to travelers to experience the culture .
To illustrate , I went to Hongkong last week and it was very nice .
The tourist showed us the culture of Hongkong and not only that , we could also eat food of Hongkong and went to places where Hongkong people usually go in daily life .
He also talked about the history of Hongkong that we could understand the culture easily and I became to have interest .
Therefore , with tour guide , travelers can know about the countries more deeply .

Moreover , I can use the money that is spent on traveling more effectively .
Some people travel to get out of daily work and to get rid of their stress .
They think they need to relax during travel but they need money to travel so I think it is not cost effective .
For instance , when I went to Cambodia , I did n't go there with a tour guide so I did n't know where to go .
So I just spent my time having rest in my hotel room which was wasting my time and money .
Even though I could have a rest at home , I chose to spend money and had a rest in other county which was not a good choice to make .
Thus , I can save money .

To wrap up , I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
First of all , I can get knowledge and learn deeply about other countries .
Also , I can use money that is spent more effectively .
