I agree with the statement that says that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars than there today '' .
In fact I have to admit , for my personal experience , that in the last ten years this was the tendence we are achieving , even if it is not a good result .

I think that in twenty years there are going to be fewer cars because of several reasons .
First of all the cities are getting bigger .
I have read last week that most of the people now live in cities .
That means that they are going to have to move inside the city , and as bigger the city becomes , as more people will need to have a car ( unless the State will offer the possibility to move with an alternative transport ) .

Secondly cities are often overcrowded , and people who do not have much money are obliged to find another place where to live out of the city .
This means once again that they are going to need a car to get to the city for working , for example .
Also there are people that dislike the style of life that often a city offers .
They would probably try to find a place where to live that is out of the city , but from where they are able to get to the city by car .

Morover I think it also depends on how the State , or the local community would act .
There are several examples that demonstrate that when a local community do not want to have too many cars in the city , some solutions can be found to resolve this problem .

The first thing is to make a good city plan , that can really help .
If a city is planned in a smart way that considers different things , as where to put major roads , or how to plan alternative transports , then to move in the city is definitely easier .

Secondly the State should try to sensibilize more and more people that live in the city , who often do not care about this topic because they are more comfortable by moving with their own car or because they think this problem does not affect them .
Which is not true , because they do not feel comfortable at all while trying not to get stuck in line or when air pollution reaches really dangerous limits !

Finally I agree with the statement , even if I think that it will be a huge problem if this actually comes true .
