Today , to move , the people , in general , use theirs cars .
The numbers of cars increase always but in an other side , the prize of cars and oil increase too .
On one hand , some people think in twenty years they will use than there are today .
Indeed , having a car is more and more expensive .
On the earth , there less and less oil so the prize increase a lot and all people can not pay it .
Moreover , in the biggest cities , the common transports will be very developed like in Paris where the government make news bus ' route .
They want that Paris will becomea citie with no cars .
Indeed , some people think we need to stop use the cars because that due to the increase of polution .

One the other hand , the cars is the best to move .
Indeed , with cars you can go everywhere and when you want .
You do not wait like with bus and subways .
Maybe the prize of oil increase , however , all government try to find a solution .
For example , in France , the government want to introduce a new oil product with cereal .
This oil is ever use in some countries like Brazil where a lot cars use this oil and where the oil is less expensive than in France .
Moverover , this vegetal oil can stop the polution in the biggest cities .
And finaly , with a car , the people do what they want like at home .
They chose the radio station they want to listen , they can fume , they can phone .

According to me , the common transport can developed a lot again .
But with the new technologies , all the people would like his own cars and I think in twenty years there be more cars in use than there are today .
