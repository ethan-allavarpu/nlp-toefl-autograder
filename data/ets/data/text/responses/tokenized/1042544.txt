`` People try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what theyalready know how to do well '' i agree with this statement because taking new things we can learn a lot adn become famous in what we are doing .
By trying new thing we can know some thing new and discover new things .
For some people after taking a lot of risk they may not get success and so they go on with there same work .
I dont agree with this statement because with out trking new thing we can not move forward .
For example : if the country is a developing country it remains a developing county for ever if they dont try new thing adn make there country a developed country .

Another example , if a person wants to become a top ranker or become an engg he need to take a lot of risk to reach his destiny , by trying different thing , thinking different and working on it .
I think it will definetly gives sucess to the person .

An example for wich i disagree the statement , if a person is not working hard or not trying anything different , then definetly he will not reach is goal and he can not he a successful person .
Similarly take sachin tendulkar , he was very poor in studies adn was verymuch intrested in cricket .
His fater took a lot of risk and started practising him cricket rather than giving coaching in this regular studies .
So because of taking lot of risk and trying new thing now we got a world class cricketar , and india is very proud to have such a player .
So this all happend just nothing but taking risk and trying new things rather than countinuing this known work .

So finally i say , `` the people who try different and like to take risk rather than doing the same work will definitly get sucess and stand on top of all '' .
