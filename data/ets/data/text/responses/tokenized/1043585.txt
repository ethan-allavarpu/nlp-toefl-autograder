In my opinion , I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than the other .
The reason why I prefer this one is that if someone is specialized in one specific subject , I think this person is quite boring person .
Lets say he knows very wel about the animals in the sea and whenever you meet with them .
He talks only about things that he is good at and nothingelse .
As I am a listener of him , I would have very boring time .

On the other hand , if you know broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people who talked with thinks that you are very smart .
You dont have to talk that much but little bit of information about many things .
Thats all you need .
Usually listeners dont try to argue with you , unless they are professioners of what you are talking .

Of course It is also good to specialize in one specific subject .
Especially if you are teacher or doctor , anyone who teach or give advices .
Then the one specific subject would be very valuable .

Actually both personalities are valuable and better than knowing nothing because you know something at least .
I had one friend who was usually quiet .
But when I let him talk about cars , he didnt stop talking untill I changed the topic .
He was so interested in cars and he likes to spent his time for cars .
