The development of the car is an uncertain issue .
Actually , people used to live without cars but since it has been created , there have been more and more cars all around the world .
Yet , I trully believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .

First of all , considering all the new technology and the constant evolution of the world , I 'm convinced that the car will finally disappeared .
Actually , people change their mind very fastly nowadays and they will soon be bored by the car , they 'll need something new .
For instance , I hope we 'll soon be able to move just by thinking about the place we want to go , it will be easier and will save energy and time .
Besides , even if the teleportation is n't created , it 's obvious that the car will disappear as fastly as it came .
Thus , a new mean of transport will be created , more powerful and more useful .

Furthermore , all the country are getting engaged for the reduction of toxic gas on earth and Kyoto agreement is the perfect example of the world we all want to fight for .
Even if some countries do n't really apply the rules at the moment , I 'm sure they will finally realize what the emergency is and they wo n't have any other choice than making efforts .
Moreover , people are more and more aware that we are acting for the future and for the next generations .
Therefore , if we want the future humans to be able to live on earth in the future , we have to stop using the car and then stop polluting .

In a nutshell , even if I 'm not sure that there will be more and more pedestrians , I 'm trully convinced that cars do n't belong to future but to past and that we 'll find solutions to be able to move as we wish without polluting too much .
