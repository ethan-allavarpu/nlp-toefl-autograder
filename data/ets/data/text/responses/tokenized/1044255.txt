Nowadys , there is a interesting thing that a lot new products are `` young people '' .
It seems like young peopel may enjoy their lives more than the older generation .
Every one has his own value about life and different values lead to a compeletely different way of life , so we can not say who enjoys himself better .

Being full of experience , old people have a different thinking about the lives from the young people .
some old people who survive from the second world war can understand how important the food or the money is , so in stead of wasting wealth on enjoying lives , they choose to lead a quite simple life .
But they never feel their lives are borin .

Second , young people have a strong willing to show their themself to attract a boyfriend or a girlfriend .
In order to be popular , young people may like to stay in pubs and bars , they drink , dance and joke with each other .
However amost all the older people have already found an acompany , and fashion , cars are less important for them , even they do not want to live as the younger people .
If it is not necessary , it does n't make sense to the judgement that young people enjoy life better .

In addtion , age may be very important in some culture .
for example , older people can control the younger one in China or Kera .
In these country , age can influence many things especially when people is having fun .
in these cultures , the society will provide more benefits to the old people .
If Chinese people have a lot of food , the old one can obtain more .
so it is not ture that young people can ejoy their life better within a less supply .

In concusion , old people are equal with the young people , that is why nobody augre about that at all .
