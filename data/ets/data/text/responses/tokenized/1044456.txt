There are two types of advertisement according to the chronological order .
One is post-modern advertisement and the other is modern advertisement .
The start of advertisement was with modern advertisement which concentrated on utility of product .
Later on , after the cold war period , post-modern advertisement concentrating on the image or impression of advertisement began flourishing and it has been mainstream of advertising technology untill present .
Now , here comes the problem .
Post-modern advertisement ties mainly with appealing method of impression and to appeal others , it needs such accentuation of positive portions and slipping out negative aspects or to cover the weakness of product competitiveness in utility , they will have to concentrate on overwhelming person with the other good aspects of products such as design .
This , can be said that advertisements nowadays make their products seem better .

It might be limited example for my country but as it is fair example , I 'll discuss it .
In my country , insurance companies put tremendous assets to visual advertisement .
They put some words like `` No additional money to pay for 2 months '' in big letters while they put some negative but crucial informations in letters that ca n't even be seen without glasses .
People see the conditions only written in the big letters which seems pretty charming to us , people .
However , they realize that they were faked when they actually borrowed loan from that company .

There is other method in making a product seems better than it is .
It is not telling about utility or any other practical values but depicting beauty merely .
This is especially severe in visual advertisement .
Impressing image overwhelms person that the person forget the real use of product is actually limited and sometimes , advertisement uses person 's mind tending to follow celebrities and hire celebrities in making advertisement .
Person , just mimic celebrities then .

Surprising psychological method inherents in post-modern advertisements tempting persom to purchase product .
By minimizing shortcoming and accentuating merits or by visually overwhelming person without any utilarian usefulness , advertisements shows product better than it is actually and people often dull , get faked by advertisements .
Definitely , we 'll have to be aware of this that we do n't get faked .
Due to the reasons above , I think that most advertisements make products seems much better than their reality , succesfully .
