The years give us intelligence in most of the times .
The statement , yong people enjoy life more than older people no it is alway true , it is depends of the style life , and personal habits .

For exemple , yong people could be always , entusiastic , happy , frendly and also serius , and quiet by the way some yung people can not enjoyed their lives , may be , because their lives culd be no the best experience , in othe words may be they do noy have the oportunity to enjoyed their parents , school , or wherever , in contrast many old people enjoy their laves , most of them thougt that their old it the most beutiful form to accumulate experience , in this way they was have alot of memories and experience .

In my opinion , my grand father is an exemple that the old people can enjoyed life , same or more than the yong people .
My grand father is 86 years old and he decided star to lived again , when he was 75 years old , after my grand mather 's dead , some people thougt that he got sad but in contrast , he has decided to write a book , and all weekend he has dancing in a club , he already open his own cantina and recently he has a girlfriend and may be he will married again in a few months .
however he has diabetics and hipertencion systemic , he decided enjoyed his life and start again like a second chance .
I think that he is a great example for yung people that some times decide to quite their dreams , hopes , and some times their own lives .
He is also a good example and a model for me , and I hope enjoyed my life same or more than him .

For this reazon , I am desagree whit the statement yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
