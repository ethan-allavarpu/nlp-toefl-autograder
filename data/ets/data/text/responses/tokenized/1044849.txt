I 'm totaly agree with the statement because if the products seller make advertisements for their products it will effect of the product 's sells .
For example , in my country some companies make cheap product but they advertises it like no one can make this product like us , we are the best .
After that , they sell like a millions of it .
Then some people get poision of that product because they use cheap things .

Also , In the US , some companies give an advertisement to a telvision channel like 10 times a day .
They are making their product in Asia , because there is no handwork in there .
So , they can make whatever they ca n't in US .
Most countries do that , even though a person can make his or her product by himself or herself .
Because they just print where the product made in .

However , people know advertisement is a way to intorduce to sell .
So , people could decide either buy it or not .
If the producters make their advertisement well , everybody will be agree that the product sell very well .
A person can recognize that a product is most powerful or harmful .
People should get the idea of the advertisement , if they do n't they can feel like `` What was that advertisement all about ? ''
.
So the person will be complicated .

Finally , If producters want to sell too much , they should make them good .
Also they should n't use cheap things .
