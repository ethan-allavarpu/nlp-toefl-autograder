there is no consensus among people as to the arguement that it is good for a group to travel led by a guide. with an increasing number of people claim that it has lots of disadvantages , some people mor e sensible tend to consider the nature that traveling with a guide is amazing . and the latter point coincides with mine for my reason below :

firstly , we never remain suspicious of the point that traving with a tour guide has an extremely affect on the mood of the memebers of the group .
for instance , statistics indicate that 70 percentage of people who has the experence of traveling with a guide will have a good mood .
another example , i often travel with my parents and we always travel with a guide .
because of the professional knowleges the guide obtained , he can arrange our activity schedule , and we should not worry any thing , what we should do is just watching and engoy the chaming view passing by .
so easy is the travel , we never feel tirde because we can focus our mood on the beatuty of view .
so the trip become happy and easy without a thinking that where we should to go to , and where is the most famous place because we can obtain totally from the mouth of the guide .
it is so cool .
and the group member will have more time chating with each other .

furthermore , it is no exaggerating to say that traveling with a guide has huge influence not just on the mood we have , but on our money as well .
for example , without a guide we are likely to buy some thing unuseful but attracting at that moment .
however if a tour guide accompanies with your group , it will not be a matter .
once our family went to qingdao which is a charming seashore town with chaming views that the seabirs are sing with sunshine .
so we are attracted by it .
when a men sell some sea food , we accept because at that moment we forget anything but the amazing view .
at that time the guide stop us because he think the price of the seafood is too high .
with his advice , we are awake .
thus , thanks to his help .
we save lots of many to buy something useful .
therefore , traveling with guide has lots of benefits that can infulence us fanancially .

as we have discussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that traveling with a guide not only can help us obtain a good mood but can save our money as well .
therefore , it is highly time that we should raise the public awareness of the significance of the guide , .
just in this way can we get a wonderful journey with other group members .
