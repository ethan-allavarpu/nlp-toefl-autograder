It is important to know both the ideas and concepts as well as the facts .
Of cource the ideas of a topic or a problem makes it easier to understand and to remember it but it takes much longer to be taught this concepts .
So sometimes it is easier to learn only facts even if they are dry and boring .
It depends on what you have to do with the information , wether if you have to write an assey about that or if it is just for your own general knowledge .
To know facts is sometimes important when you are talking to or discussing with other people .
To show them in a short time that you have a big knowledge about different subjects , you will need facts .

To come back to the ideas and concepts I can say that if you have a big interest in something it is not enough just to know about the facts .
Also for yourself you want to know more and understand the whole thing .
If you have exams in this topic , it is much easier to answer the asked questions because you have the background .

For myself I prefer to learn ideas and concepts .
I am studying and at the university it is very important to understand the problem .
The exams are very difficult and hard .
So if you are not prepared and only know the facts , you are lost .
But sometimes if I read the newspaper or watch TV , I try to remember short facts .
Usually I do not have the time to read about every topic too long so I just remember the most important things .
After that I know what other people are talking about , not at all but I can understand the problem or topic because of the learned facts .
To sumerize I would say that ideas and concepts are important to know when it is your cource or work .
But facts are good to know for social relations .
