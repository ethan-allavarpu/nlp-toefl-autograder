Things are changing every day .
In pass 50 years , you could not believe that people can use the computers to do a lot of things .
You could not believe somethings which is happend Today .
So Young people is changing also , they enjoy their lives more than older people do .
There are three points can prove this .

First , young people will not think about when they become old what will happen .
They just want to enjoy their lives now .
Prepare to the Older people , there is a big different .
Older people will think about their family , their retire payment , their future lives .
They will save money for that .
They also will reduce their ativities for health .
But young peope will not do that .
They want to spend more time with friends .
lovers and some modren things .
They do not have saving account , they like use visa , and use more money in their habits .
In fact , they do not have the plan for the future .

Second , Young people is more easier to pay attetion on some new things .
They will be mad on computer game , cars , clothes and so on .
At that time , they will spend more money and more time on it .
Do not say i am young , i still have much time to do my future work .
That is wrong , Because you do not have that money to enjoy your life .
You only use older people 's money to enjor your life .
Prepare to older people , their situation is opposite .
They will not pay attetion on new things , they just want themsleves to have good final lives .

Third , Young people will not think about thier families , they think thier lives are more important .
They will say i must enjoy my life without odler people .
They do not want to stay with mother or father .

They only know friends .
Althouht there have ages problems between oder people and young people and they will not enjoy life together , young people do not have any pionts about their family .

Anyway , YOung people
