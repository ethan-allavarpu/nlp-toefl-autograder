When I was 16 years old I traveled with my mother all around Europe .
She paid to a travel agency to have a guide in our trip .
That adventure was amazing !
if I would have the chance to experiment the same situation , I would not have second thoghts about paying a tour guide again .
So I am completely agree with the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .

First of all , I am agree with paying someone to show me around because it is the best way to visit everything in a city , in which I do not know anything about it .
Furthermore , this guide can show me the history , the monuments , the anegdotes , traditional restaurants and places to party , and all of these for the same price !
For instance , in the trip that I mencionated at the begining , the one that I did with my mother , this guide showed us every single place of France ; actually my mother went by her self three years before we did and thank this guide she learnt new more things about Paris .

Second of all , If I travel with a guide tour I am going to be save because this person supposes to know the right ways at the best times to visit the city so I do not have to worry about which rout should I take to not surprise my self with any problem .

To summarize I prefer to travel with a tour guide because I think that it is the best way to learn things about a new place .
In addition , a person is better than a book , because any question you have she or he can answer it at the moment and also the personal experiences of a tour guide are more interesting that the onces that you can find in a book .
