Most companies allot a huge amount to advertisment .
Why do they do that ?
Is is still beneficial after using thousands of dollars just on the advertisement ?
As the matter in fact , it is .
I actually read an artical about a drink advertisement using a Korean top star .
The sales of the product has increase dramatically after advertisement .
Why has this phenomenon happen ?

First , most advertiser tries to make a good image of the product through the advertisment to attract customers .
There 's actually no one trying to complain their own product on TV .
Hence , the consumers unconciously accept that the product on the TV or the papers are actually better through the images that the advertisement .
For example , creating an image of beauty or health by using Jessica Alba on the picture makes people think that `` Oh , if I use that product , I will be beautiful and healthy like Jessica Alba . ''

Furthermore , advertisement put unconcious trust in people 's mind .
It is an human instinct that the product that we know is better than others unknown .
And advertisements make products more widely known .
People just simply ca n't trust things that they do n't know about .
Hence , by using the phenomenon , advertising creates a kind of fake trust on the product .
For example , what would you use between a Pantene or a shampoo you never saw , even though you never used both .
Most of the people would choose pantene because they know it .

Advertising is a kind of magic or trick that attracts people to use it and it 's actually the purpose of the progress .
By soaking a pleasant image of Hollywood star , for example , and using the human instinct of preference to famous products , it paralyze people to buy them .
However , we have to be aware that `` A picture means more than thousands of word . ''
We have to experience ourselves than just experiencing through a TV .
