I have always considered travelling as excellent method to know many people and to know many different cultures .
But it could be a little bite expensive and dangerous if you do not have the apropriate instruction .
In this paper I want to disscuss about the advantages and disadvantages that we could appear when we are travelling with out a suitable orientation .

First at all , If we are travelling in a group led by a tour quide , we can feel safer and more confident to explore new things and landscapes .
It is due to the expertise and experience that a tour guide could have .
Moreover , the guide could show to the travellers the important and interesting places that the group should visit during the trip .
It is too important because it can be saved money and time . !
you go straight to the point .
It is fantastic .

On the other hand , if we travel in group led by a tour guide we can feel uncomfortable with many things .
One of them is that you can not visit some places when you want do it because it is usually that a tour guide has a travelling route decided and scheduled before the trip has started .
Adding this point , you can not enjoy isoleted spaces and activities because most of the time you have to share different activities with tthe all group and it can be boring experience .

From my point of view it is very important to travel with someone else , but if I have the opportunity to do it in group it is wonderful .
Because of the mutual cultural and interpersonal exchange .
Youcan enjoy and involve in many activities easily .
But if you group has a tour guide is excelent tool to know a a lot of places using less time and money .
I think the most important issue if you want to travel is to be prepared to do it alone , in a group or with a tour guide .
It doesn not matter , jus take into account your happiness and your feeling to have fun .
