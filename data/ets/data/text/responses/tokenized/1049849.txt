Some peopel claim that the number of cars will be down because not only the pollution arised by cars is very serious and but also the various public transportation system is developing .
However , I firmly believe that people want still the convenience of the car and eco-friendly cars are developing now .

At first , the amount of the car 's manufature is inceasing continuouly .
That is because people would like to have their own car for the convenience of movement .
The study by Korean Public Transpormation Instute showed that The main reason that Seoul citizens ' favorate way to go to work was their own cars ' convenience .
They can enjoy driving except for the traffic-jam time and do their favorate activities freely , such as llistening the music .
Even though the government makes the public transportation better condition , people will not satisfy with their trying .

As far as the environmental issue , it is not a big problem since many contries try to develop the eco-friendly cars .
This investment also means that people still admit the cars ' practice and convenience more than other ways to move .
Several month ago , in Japan , some researchers inovated the electronic vehicle , which can be used by normal persons .
So , in the future more people use will use nature friendly cars .

In these respects , I disagree the statment that the number of cars low
