I 'm agree with the affirmation that says : young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I have twentythree years old therfore i am a young boy , in this period my life is very enjoy and for this i am happy .
In this last years I have done some things , many of this was very important for my growth , many of this was very enjoy , but at the other hand there was some bad moments .
Moreover I can say that in my life the good period are more present than bad period .

I 'm young and this thing is very beautiful , in this period of my life i can do some enjoyed things , for examples yestarday i played with my friend at football , in other days I had played at baseball , cricket , basketball . .

Young old let me do this thing , becouse my body is ok , I do n't have problem , I 'm healtly .
At the moment i think that i can do everything !
it 's a good sensation , the best i have never had .

At the other hand this good period ca n't continue for all my life , in this case i could is an highlander !
There is a period of our life that all things is more difficult than in youth .
This difficult period is when the people come to be an older person .
This is the ultimated state of our life , when our body come to be ill , old . ..

I think that there are some good moment in this sad period , the close contact with our relative develops one strong rapport , is important , in this manner we can be more happy than only .

In conclusion I think that young people are more enjoy than the older , but we must love our life , becouse in unique and indispensable .
