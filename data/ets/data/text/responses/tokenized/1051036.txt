I firmly believe that exist any men 's finest hour , and I am not able to say if it comes in early or latest period of our lives .
Generally I think that a men 's finest hour comes when he worked hard for years and years , to finally discover that he was right in his life and so was the things he had worked to , and this discovering happens when he finally lies on his battlefield , exhausted , but victorious .
Homer said that men become more tired of drinking , dancing and making love , than making war : so he would say that men are always in war , and only the dead saw the end of it , not because their are bad or barbarians , but because they enjoy to live their life on the edge , to take match every day , to demonstrate they are victorious .
I think this is the meaning of `` enjoy life '' : to take part every day in new competitions , going away victoriuos , in the end .
Now , I 'm not able to say when occours our best hour , it may happens when we 're old or when we are young , the meaning thing is enjoy this moment .
Young boy , probably , live their lives and do n't think too much at the far future , when they will be old , like De'Medici said in his poems .
Opposite this arguments , we can say that old people have a heavy bag full of cultural notions and experience , and they think much more at the thing they have to do , careing not only to themselves , but to all the people they have around and with have relationships .
In ancient times they said : `` Only the good die young '' , but this thinking was strictly joined to a pagan vision of the world and life .
Now is the coulture of the christians that found its way to rule the world , and we can say that we have not only a heroic youngness , but also a respectable middle or old age : this period of life is not yet rated like the autumn .

We can enjoy life in every period of our life at the same matter , it do n't care how much years you carry on .
