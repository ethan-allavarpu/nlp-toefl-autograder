Yes , i agree to the statement .
we need to keep broad knowladge on all academic subjects when compare to specific subject .
Becouse in plimanary studys each one of the subject is inter link with other subject .
means getting some knolwdage on each and every revelent subject is good for basics of studys .
vains are connect to each and every part of the body and supplys blood to function in good health .
if a person is suffering form internal pain from a body , the patceient is to carry to hospital and checkep by the doctor and identified some deficts .
planed to do opperation each and every doctor should have some knowladge on all parts of human body naither than that doctor can not make operation with out having knowladge in relivent parts .
suddenally the doctor is having good knowladge in vains for example , a general doctor can not read about one topic are one specific subject .
in human body each and every part is related with another part , so the person who studying doctor to need all relevent subjects of human body to be a successful doctor .

Where as in mathemetical caliculations to caliculate the estimated cost of project , needs addition , ubstraction , muliplication & division .
then only the final result will be appear .
so some of the cases there should be good knowladge in relivent subjects and same as we can improve the communication and good relitaion ship between among people .
we need to have knowladge in all aspects , then only we can servive in the society .
having good knowladge all aparts is good .
each and every genious is to have waste experan So we use to have broad knowledge on academic subjects is good off specific subject
