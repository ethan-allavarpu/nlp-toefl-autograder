Advertising , which is a tool used by many bussiness experts or techies to gain much more profits and also reputaion .
The art of advertising brought a dramatical change in the marketing world .

The products shown in the `` add '' , the short form of advertising , may not be the same as they really are .
The purpose of advertising is to grab the look of the consumers towards the product .
If a product gains the look of the consumers , it may get them buying it .
The sample shown in the advertisement may vary with real .

For example , the automobile industry , they show the the performance and accessories of thier product in a speculating way , but the real differs from the shown and also during the advertisement , they make an asterisk mark on the mileage or any other they show , But none observes that , which mean below of that `` under standard testing conditions '' .
Generally consumer can not notice that because the font size is very small .

Not only the automobile , lets take the financial area .
In this the finanace companies show thier plans of insurance are much better among the other .
They only announces the benifits of the plan but not the risks of the plan .
Which is a clever way of cheating the public .

If and only if the company makes a good reputation among the market , it can survive long with profits .
To achieve this main objective , the products are shown much better in the advertisement .
Ofcourse , there are some products which are real , forexample , the jewellary products which are shown wil bwe the same as the real .

The use of latest technology in photography also one of the cause of this debate .
The use of xeon lights makes a product glitter and also the highly sophistcated cameras can capture even trash as a beautiful thing .
How ever , I agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
