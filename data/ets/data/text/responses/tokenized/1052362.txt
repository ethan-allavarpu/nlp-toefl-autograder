The world we live in had a hard time because of several wars .
The victims of the wars are not only this world , but also the old .
Old people had to reconstruct their world which had destroyed , whoever did .

Even though there are still several wars , this world relatively got recovered .
Old people struggled to get out of the hard time , bringing bacons home for their families , and they kept living for their families .
Now they have children who all grown-up , and time to spend for themselves .

People say that the old do n't know how to enjoy their lives ; I do n't think so .
They had a hard time , so they know how thankful they are being alive now , and how precious their lives are .
They might look like they are still only working , but they know what the life is .
They enjoy their lives thinking their lives profoundly .

Young people consider enjoying their to be very important .
They go surfing in summer and snowboarding in winter , and they say , `` I 'm enjoying my life . ''
Yeh , they enjoy their lives , but they , i think , enjoy lives just for fun .
There is no purpose to enjoy their lives .
They take it for granted .

Enjoying life need responsibility with purpose .
Without it , people underestimate how important their lives are .
A young man who always `` enjoy '' his life commits suicide suddenly one day .
Even though it might be true that he enjoyed his life , he had no purpose .

Old people have a lot of experiences .
They get to have responsibilities on their families , and know how awesome their lives are .
Who 's more enjoying life ?
I think we have to enjoy with pupose .
