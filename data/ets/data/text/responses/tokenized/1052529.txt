Many products are advertised in TV because it 's the main media nowsaday .
Many people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , others believe that most advertisements put the products as they really are .
I think that advertisements make products to seem better to make more money , atract more people and exapand their bussines

One reason is to make lot of money .
Many of this owners do n't have any respect for others .
These persons just want to buy you something for a high price and maybe the price is lower than they said it is .
Like my grandfather .
She wanted to buy a computer and she saw an advertisement on TV that said that the computer worth three thousand dollars .
Because she was naive in computers , she bought it .
When she told to my father that she bought a computer fotr that price , my father almost kill her because he said that the computer only worth one thousand dollars .

Another reason is beacuse the owner wants to atract people with this product .
They just car to atract the maximum quantity of people .
For example , my mother bought a vacuum machine that she saw on TV .
She said that this was the best one that she have aver seen .
When the vacuum arrived , she was excited and she started to use it .
In four days the vacuum broke and she could n't use it anymore .

Finally , this advertisements make products better because the owners want to expand their bussines .
For this reason they can sell more things and also make maore money .
First they start selling only one product but with the money they made with this product , they will start making other products as a result , they will expand their bussines .

To conclude I would say that many advertisement make products much better than really are because the owners want to make more money , atract more peolpe and expand their bussines .
I think that these people should have more respect whith their customers and make advertisement to show the product the way they are and not the way they want to look like .
