Nowadays , with the technology making significantl progress , Our live become more and more wonderful and convinent .
So many people begain considering how to enjoy their life .
As a young people , however , i strongly disagree the statement on the left screen and there are too many instance to support my view .

Firstly , as we know , our society is becoming aging and our warfare becoming more and more lighten .
That give a rise to new situation that so many elders spend their leisure hours in travel .
That is why the travel agency is the one of the most lucrative industry in this era .
For examlp , my parents usually spend 4 months in different cites .

In addition , many older people have less presuer from jobs than young people .
Most of them have fixed pension .
They do n't worry about their finacial problem .
That give them chance to enjoy life .

My uncle get a incridible pension and he do n't save it .
He usually spend so much in food and intertaiment .
Furthermore , our society need youth to make progress .
That can continue a great cycle .
If we enjoy life , that means we do n't want a confortable life when we become old .
Any developed countris should has many ambitious youth to maintain its prosperousity From what has been discussed above , we can finally draw the conclusion that the older people enjoy life more than young people .
