I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reaons .
First , I believe that the governments of many countries in the world are recently beginning to restrict the use of cars because of their several serious problems .
For example , cars emit carbon monoxide when they burn gasoline , which is poisonous to people , animals and plants .
In addition , cars also emit caron dioxide which is responsible for the greenhouse effect .

Second , the governments also restrict the use of vehicles due to fear to depletion of natural resources , especially petroleum .
That valuable natural resource is necessary for vehicles to move -- i.e. , to burn gasoline .
In addition , it is necessary to manufacture vehicles .
For example , the process of manufacturing cars needs high temperature which is given by petroleum .
Moreover , cars use plastics as parts thereof , and needless to say , plastics are produced from petroleum .

In addition , according to medias and recent official reports by United Nations , the governments of many countries in the world are not only beginning to restrict the use of cars , but also trying to find alternative transportaions which do not have problems which cars have .
For example , in my nation , Japan , the govenment has been investing in the research for commercializing of the `` linear motor car '' .
It moves by energy of magnetts , so that does not emit any poisonous gas .
Experts estimate that the linear motor car will be used more popurarly in 15 years .

Therefore , I agree the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in used than there are today for there reasons .
