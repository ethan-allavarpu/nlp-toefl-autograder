In my opinion , older people enjoy life more than young people .
`` Enjoy oursleves and have all the fun we could have . ''
Is what most young people thinking of .
They spend time to do sports , to date with people , tend to clubs and pubs to find their fun ; drink and smoke to make themselves feel more high , more excited .
It 's not a healthy life , and not a responesble life also .
When people are young , mostly they spending money given by their parents , instead of spending money earned by themselves .

And , secondly , young people always tend to be selfish and takeing less care about others .
They do n't actually know how important other people rolling in their life .
In that case , they will do less contribution to the either farmily or community .
So , in my view , young people do not know `` how '' to enjoy life .

In contrast , old people , on the other hand , think otherwise . ''
Enjoy ourselves with other people , have fun while we can . ''
Is what they think .
They are more matural and know what they are supposed to do .
Old people usually go travel when they have free time and extra financial abilities .
They go to clubs too for different purpose , have a drink with friends or old classmates .
Most of them know how to lead a life which is healthy and full of happiness .

Also , old people know how to make themsleves helpful and valuble to others .
They know hwo to share happiness with other people .
Especially when they had their children .
They enjoy a real `` life '' .

In all , old people know how to enjoy the life and they are enjoying more than young
