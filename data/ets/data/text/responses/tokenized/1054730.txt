There are two way for training to work and to live .
One of these is speecializing in one specific subject , the other is studying in order to have a broad knowledge .
In my opinion each of these ways has some advantagesand some disadvantages , but the second is the best .

As regards the first possibilty , that is having a specific knowledge , I think that the most important advantage is that who has a specific education , have a high possibility to find a job , a well rewarding job , in the field where he or she studies in depht .
Indeed , nowadays , firms and companies , look for people who can give a sensible help to the firm .
Students well prepared are a competitive factor that allow firms to gather much money .

On another hand , people or students who have a wide range of interests , who study different subjects , have the possibility to use the informations they gather during their training in order to create a good social life .
Moreover I think that these people are more flexible in change their work during their life .

For these reasonss , even if at first view , the first kind of knowledge could seem better , I think that , expecially in the liong time , for example during the whole life , the second kind of knoledge is more useful for people .

I think so , because I chose to study a subjet in depht , that is management engineering , and I study this subject in depht for making myself more competitive that the others students in the world of job .
Whene I have some free time I prefer not to spend it in reading because I 'm very tired for my work at university .
But when I meet people studing something different from economical , mechanical or industial subjects , and I talk with them about something they have discussed in class or they have read in a magazine I alway feel that I 'm incomplete , my education is incomplete , because even if I 'm clever I have n't the basic informations to say my opinion about the topic .
So I think that everyone should be spend part of the day to read magazine , journal and so on in order to have a rewarding life .
