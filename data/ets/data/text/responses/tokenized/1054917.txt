Nowadays , it is important in times of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject .
Before applying students should take following aspects in consideration .

Firstly , it is often mentioned that being a specialist of a certain area makes it easier once you finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation .
However , having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects gives you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads .
Being generalistically offers you a way to enter a company more easily .
Once you are received the job you still can and you even have to , no matter being a specialist or a generalist , adopt to tyhe needs of the company you are working for .

Secondely , it is argued that specifying in a certain field does not take the same time as studying the basics of many different areas .
To some limited extend there is some truth in it , but , undoubtely , experience shows that no metter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same .
Nevertheless , doing a generalistical degree is in my point of view better than completing a specific degree that takes the same time .
In other words your possibilities are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only being specified .
And the time you have spend remains the same .

To summarize , students first of all should be aware of the consequences when considering applying after they obtained a degree in a specific subject .
Furthermore they should mistrust the rumour that studying with the objective to get a broad knowledge of many academic subjects takes the same time then it would achieving a specific degree .
