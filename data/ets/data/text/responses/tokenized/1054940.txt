Should we learn or should we understand ?
This question may have been a debate for ages .
Everybody wonders if he had better to learn or to understand .
But could we really understand without learning ?

I agree this the statement , because I really think that it is not always helpful to learn by heart .
I think it is more important to understand something and to develop our critical judgement .
But both are really important .

Nevertheless , I think we should learn in order to be able to understand what happen is our life or in our society .
Let 's take an example .
If we want to understand a politic debate or we want to vote .
We should know and learn what is a republican or a demorcrate , in order to vote right .
In our life , we always need to know something to understand it .
Thus the importance of learning .

However , we should be carful of not learn without understanding , which is completly stupid .
An example may be when somebody has well learned how to write words .
If he does not practice or understand how to make a sentance , it is completly useless to know words .

Despite the fact that learning by heart something could be very boring , we should be able to do it .
Because the more we will have learned a subject , the more we will be able to talk about it and to understand it .
So if we learn how is the american parliament , we should better understand the role of G. Bush for example .

Therfore , I think that we should not decide only to understand or only to learn .
These two notions should go together , they are complementary .
Although nobody really like to learn by heart , we must do it , in order to understant better what happens in our life or in our societz .
