There are two reasons why the amount of cars used by people would be reduced in the future .
The first reason is that people would take environment under concideration alot more than they do now .
Another reason is that economical status may be effected toward the worse in the future .

people would appreciate good and healthy environment more in the future because of the fact that it is rapidly changing to the worse now .
If we looked to the earth as a creature it would not be in a good health ; it would be `` ill '' and it wont take people long time to notice that , and as soon as they do and as soon as this fact shocks them back to their sence , they would be acting in a more responsible ways and will take emmediate actoins to prevent further ilnesses from apearing and that 's where the reduction of using cars must take place .
Take the global warmig issue for example , it is already capturing peoples attention and driving people to wanting to do somthing about it .

The enviromental status will have larger impact on the human sociaty and would most propably change it 's economical structure .
once that is done the idevidual wont be able to have the luxsiery of having his / her own car and there fore will force the reduction of using cars onto sociaty .
Other methods of transportation would be even more popular than it is now .
For example , public transportation , it would be a must and not an option .
Not neglicting the fact the they are being used now very often .
but is that for the right reasons ?

Perhaps If more people understood that fewer cars would do good for our planet we wont have to wait for twenty more years for people to stop using these harmful machines .
