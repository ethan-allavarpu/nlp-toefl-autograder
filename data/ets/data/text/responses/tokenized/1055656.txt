I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

In my high school in California , lots of students form the small tutoring groups in order to help those students who have questio in perticular subjects or who live in pool families .
They meet everyday after schools in the library , not only studying their homework but also helping other students .
Yet there are some students who could n't pay the money to the test-prep schools or the college-prep program in community college ; those who formed the tutoring groups would answer almost all the question those helpless students have .
I was one of those helpless students because I just arrived from foreign country ; however , they helped me improving my English ability .
Now I participate in the group and teach other students in Math and Chinese .
As young people , I think my classmates and my friend all did a good job in helping the communities .
I believe that there are other students groups in other schools that are doing the same job .

In summer time , most of my friends would participate to take care of the children or old people .
Some of those children have no parents , some of them were abandoned .
Once a time I participate in the service , I read stories to them .
At first I was thinking of practicing my English reading ability ; however , I cry after I went home because I feel I want to do more for them but I could n't .
I asked more of my friend to join this service , and we all learn different thing from it .
One of my friend she had once participate in a service in a hospital .
She talked to the old people , and then she read the books and newspapers to them .
She told me that , participating in a community service was a really different expericence , and it would lead you to lear more about life , about helping other people but not asking the reward of it .

Young people do participate to help their community without speaking of it loudly ; they chose to help the society silently .
Once they join it , they would continue the service .
