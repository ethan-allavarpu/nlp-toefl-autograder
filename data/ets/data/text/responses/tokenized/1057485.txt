I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .
As cars mainly depends on fuels that are conventional , there resouses are limited .
This might increase the demand for the petroleum and there products .
After some years or due to continues increase in fuel costs may forces people to move away from the cars and they mostly depend on public transport which is quite economical and has several advantages .

Governament will implement different plans to discouage people to use cars by lavying heavy taxes on regestration , insurance charges , road taxes & yearly reneveal charges .
which makes not affordable for the people to own a car .
Due to continues decrease in petroleum resourses , the auto manufacturing companies are focussing on non-conventional sourses like Electric car , Hybrid car .
As electric car is limited for certain distance and it requires to charge than for some time to make it run again which is a major drawback .

A hybrid car works on uses more than one fuel to run , which is quite costly but it is stated as a future car .
In future , we may see only these cars running on roads .

Due to increase in population the number of car user increases which will increase the emmissions of gases like co2 , lead particles into the air .
This will damage our environment and hazardious to health .
Because these gases may cause lung cancer , respiration problems .

so , it is the responsibility of governament to encourage people use more public transport which makes less depend on petroleum , environmental friendly , less crowding the roads and economical also .
