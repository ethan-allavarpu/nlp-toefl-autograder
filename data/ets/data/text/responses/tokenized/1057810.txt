Well its a kind of statement that can be made just to encourage kids to learn more and new things in their life .
But as the saying goes that `` All that glitters is not gold '' the same can be applied to successful people as well .
The fundamental cause of this problem is not in the people we talk about , but its within us .
It is because we always measure a successful person only when his / her work achieves more recognition / fame and or money and that he/she is really worth something which most of us are not .
Thus its very hard to judge and measure success in terms of money or fame or recognition , as for him its just a task he wanted to accomplish for himself .

Lets consider a sport say soccer .
We know that some of the players do play very well compared to rest of the players of that game , but in reality they only play those games which they practiced for years without having to gain success in other games .
The very same way we can not just say the founder of microsoft has been a very successful person as he did not do any thing apart from being in the business of providing software for computers .
I wonder how much of knowledge or expertise he would have in the area of mining , the same would be the case in the designer ware and clothing segment of business .
Interestingly there was an argument that walmart or the other chain stores should be considered successful people .
I would opine against the people as well in terms of success as what they had been doing is that of selling .

I definitely would have said some peron successful if he would have achieved a good name and money in the area of selling , also gaining the same momentum in other areas such as manufacturing and in research .
Thus I would rather say that some people remain successful even when they try new things .
