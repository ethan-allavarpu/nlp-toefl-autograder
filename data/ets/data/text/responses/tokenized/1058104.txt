In my opinion , young and older people enjoy life equally but in different ways .
Being young or older have advantages but also disadvantages .
First of all , when you are young , you do not have the same pleasures as you are old .
On one hand , when you are young , you enjoy your life at the current moment .
Indeed , during your studies , you prefer to go out with friends , to do sport , to discover new things by travelling . ..
However , on the other hand , when you are older you enjoy different things of the life .
Indeed , you want to get married , to have children , to buy a nice house , to go on hollidays with all your family , to succeed at work . ..

Secondly , responsabilities of a student are totally different comparing to an older person .
Indeed , as a student , you do not have many reponsabilities because most of cases , you do not have a child to take care of and you depend a little bit of your parents who help you financially .
The main responsability of a student is to have good marks and to succeed in his studies .
When you are older , you have much more responsabilities .
If you have a family you have to take care of by working , buying food , paying bills . ..
Having responsabilities as an adult enable them maybe to enjoy less life .
However , having reponsabilities can be a good thing for some adults because thus they think they are usefull .

Finally , young people can enjoy less life than older people do because they generally have less money .
If you are a student , it is more difficult for you to go on hollidays or to go regularly to the cinema .
In most of cases , students have to work and go to the university at the same time in order to pay their distractions and their university .
Contrary , older people does not have to work and study at the same time and generally they have a better salary .

To conclude , when you are a student or when you are an adult , you enjoy life differently because their situation of the life is different
