Opinions might exists over whethe most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
Personally , I agree with the above statement because advertisements are a method to maximize companies profits .
As well , the time for advertisements is dramatically short .

To start with , the purpose of making advertisements is to attract their customers .
Today 's society , many companies exist , and many products are made by them .
As a result , the companies tend to draw people to buy their goods .
In this sense , advertisements are one of the best way to increase selling rates .
to illustrate , everyday , people are surrounded by the numarable number of advertisement .
To hold the people 's attention , the functions of goods in advertisement are different with original functions of it .
My mother is a case in point .
She often suffers from bad flu and buy medicine after watching medical advertisements .
However , she always failed to find effective medicine for her flu .
This is because every goods in advertisements seems increasingly perfect for her , but they did not cure her pain .
As a result , she has no choice but to buy new medicine .
As illustrated above , most advertisements fake people in certain degree of functions for more profits .

What is more , the time of adverisements is dramatically short and companies have to give people impressions about their products in the short time .
Therefore , they have no choice but to make products seem much better than original .
