Broading kowledge of many academic subjects is much better than specializing in one specific subject in my opinion .
Not only because it will be more interesting but also because people will benifit more if the subejects are varied .

The main reason that broading knowledge is more helpful is that people will be aware of many things in this world .
they can expand their knowledge in an easy way too .
If the subjects are limited , a lot of people wont care to know about other things in the world or in the kingdom which we live in .
They will be satisfied to have the informations that are circuld around the environment they live in .
I cant judge and say that all people will have poor knowledge , but i 'm sure that the majority wont have that good knowledge .
In other words , our society will be weak .

Also if knowledge is limited to omly one subject , scientist would n't have reached the success which they have today .
For example , if Nuoten did n't bother to expand his research on the gravity and stayed on figuring out why the apple had fallen toward the ground , i do n't think he would have known the formula of gravity at all .
he could have spend his whole life thinking alone and not knowing the reason of gravity .
I think that his effort in studying every single detail made him conclude the concept of gravity .

If i were given the choice in any university or in any school whether to study only my major or have additional subjects , i would choose to study both my major and other additional subjects .
that way i will be not only well educated but also my mind will have a good understanding of the world which i 'm living in .
