It is a very common idea among young people that they are more enjoying life than older people , especially their parents !
But are you happy only when you have fun ?
I do no think so .
I belive that at each stage of your existence you `` enjoy life '' in a different way .

First , when you are young , you have no childs .
One can consider that , as he has no constraints such as feeding his offspring , he is more enjoying life .
But I think that I will be deeply happy when my child will grow up and become an autonomous human being .
At that that time , despite all the constraints , I think that I will `` enjoy life '' .

In addition when you are young , even if your entertain yourself playing tennis for example , you can not do everything you want .
You have to respect your parents rules .
Being an adult allow you to choose your activities and experience new leisure .
For example my mother used to prevent me from swiming because she was afraid of water .
I discovered this sport quite late but now I really enjoy it .
Moreover , when you are older , you start appreciating new activities .
When I was young I found highly bizzare the idea of watching paintings for hours .
But now I am fond of art exhibitions !
In the meantime I learned to enjoy life in a different manner .

Being older also enable to have a professional life .
You can manage to reach great achievement and be financially rewarded for it .
When I received my first income , I was really happy !
The idea of making money just using my brain still thrills me .
It is a way of enjoying life that I never thought about when I was in my early ages .

In a nutshell I think that being happy and enjoying life is not a matter of age .
It is more an ability to enjoy the best moments and learn from the worst .
I hope being hppy with such a philosophy of life !
