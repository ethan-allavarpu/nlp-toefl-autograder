`` Life is just one , and we have to substract from it all as we can '' , I mentioned and used that phrase all my life .
Since I was a kid , I understood that I have goals , the ones that made me work and continue through school and college .
I experienced a lot of things , which made me the man I am today .
I took risks during that time , like moving from my town to get a better education , but at the same time I continue with the same goals and doing what I did best , maths and sciences .

I understand that people do both , they take risks , while they do what they know how to do well .
For example , a story about a guy that knows how to sell TV 's to people .
After doing that for a long-time period for a `` X '' company , he realized that he could do that kind of job with his own company , and he quit the job .
Then he started his own company named with his son 's name .
Thats was the huge risk he took but he understood that people like him had choices , and that he will be success because he knows how to do the job .

With that story , an integrationg of risks and experiences can be observed .
He do know where he is good at , and he use that to try new things .
My experience tell me , that I should integrate both , while they are acceptable .
My life is made about experiences , and each day I take risks to keep living .

Overall , I do not agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
People are the owners of your actions , and the success will depend on it .
A person can be success by just doing what they know how to do , or by trying new things , which will take them again to the point of doing what they know how to do .

I know that my future is around scieces , but I do know that I have to take risks to achieve my proffesional goal , be a Meteorologist .
I have to move from my home-country , knowing that is for my own good .
Thats the bigest risk I will experience next year , while at the same time I know how to talk to people , make new friends , and take the best from every opportunities I encounter .
Success is around the courner and should experience it with new things or by just doing what they do best .
