In the everchaging world new products are devloped and with new features that customers demand that their products should accomplish and due to increase in the companies and their produts each one want to increse their share and want to dominate the market , advertisements seem to play key role in sale of the product

I agree with the fact that the advertisements make products seem better that actually they are .
In order to trap the customers the comapny show the produts in a great manner they give great publicity and employ celebrities in publicing them ultimatly when customer buys the product and then what happens ?

the customer feels cheated and he becomes red on the comapny for example , it was told buy a company in the part of their publicity stunt to have an upper hand over thier commpetiotors they have produced a bike that would give a mailage of 120km / liter of petrol to attract the customers they have hidden the truth that they have overstated the mileage many of the customers bought the the bike they practically experince it by riddng the bike what they have felt that that the product is under perfoming , they went to the comapny and asked for the fact but the comapny officials seemed that they responce was not upto the mark what the customers expected the went to the customer court and thay got their money back .

In the above stated example the case gives a vey good lime light into the topic , that is right that the comapny lost lot of money in paying thier money and in insted it got a bad fame and any person doesnt even think having that comapnys product The comany feel that publicity is every thing , they think that seeing is beliving , they are in that vision and advertise hugely on the qualities and standards that the product doesent accomplish , but in reality seeing is not everythging we might belive , usually we should not belive in every thing we see .

comanys should be transparent and shoul advertise what the product does really have in order to have long term good relatiopn with the customer and maintining a good name of the company .
