I think that both lifes are so much different from each other .
Young people live in a completly different world .
And the idea of `` enjoying life '' that old people have , most of the times is not even close to what young people consider `` Enjoying life '' All depends on what is your own idea of living the life , for some poeple no matter young or old , the idea of `` Enjoying the life '' can be partying all the time , on the other hand for other people it can be , raising a family .

The differences between a young person and an old person are so big .
Those two different groups have different styles of living ; and even in those groups there are many different sub-groups .

These differences are based on what you believe or think .
Sometimes the defferences between a young guy and an old person might be few .

Let 's just say that the life of a young person goes around his college , his friends , partying , and basicly doing what they do , they would n't be able to do no longer when they grow up .

And in my opinion the old people 's life goes around having peace , and most of the time around family .
We all know there are young and old people who do not enjoy their lifes at all , they have a pretty much boring life .

We all know that young people are always getting in troubles , they are always having issues and complaining about evertything .
But now if we just stop a moment and think for a second , what moves old people 's life in my opinion is young people 's life .
Just like cops , in most part of their jobs they have to deal with teenagers .

And Who is always there to get us out of troubles ?
Yes , old people .

As a conclution I can , say that both young and old poeple can enjoy their lifes .
As a young guy , my idea of enjoying the life is : studying , partying , and basicly hanging out with friends .
But also I know old people who share my idea of enjoying the life .
I jus trutly believe that my time to enjoy the life in some way is now , after this will come a different style to enjoy my life .
