It all dependswath enjoy life means for people , live or live in excess , as much the better .
I belive that young people enjoy life if that is go to parks or beaches and practice extreme and dificult sports .
Young people can stay late at night , drinking or dancing but the also can wake up early in the morning and go to work .
They do n't have limits in how much risk and danger they take .
Much young people receive economic support from their parents and that give them more time to enjoy .
Parents always try to give their kids the life style they never enjoy .
The society and the process of evolution in technology give also an advance to joung people for experience new ways of enjoy life .
Young people do n't focus to much in the future , they just want life and enjoy the present .

In the other hand is the old people who is feeling the weight of life in their body .
Even if they take care well of their body , older people ca n't practice sports or social life from long periods of time .
Somentimes thats not really important because everything in excess is bad .
Older people see life from other pont of view .
They do the same than joung people but not in the same intensity .
They discover the beauty of life and develop the quality of look for the detail .
The detail give you the hability to recognize when someone or somenthing is special .
seeing the quality versus quantity when you give or receive is an art that need to be cultivate .
The precious reality in this situation is that everyone is going to experience at some point of their life both sides of the human nature .
I am a 37 years old male with a latin tradition .
I love my LORD JESUS and believe that at this point of my life , I stay with the old people .
I prefer quality versus quantity .
