In seeing how the total consumption of gas is consequent nowadays and regarding the fact that it will increase with the rise of China 's consumption , the car issue must be debated .
However more the disparition of the use of car , I think an evolution of them is going to happen .

Even if the gas issue may raises questions about slowing the use of cars for different reasons - for instance because it entails environnemental problems such as the ozone layer depletion , and also because while ressources are decreasing the gas consumption is still rising - in my opinion it wo n't happen .

Indeed cars are a fundamental part of civilians everyday life , it has been one the most sold item since the 1950's .
Today in most cases it has become very difficult to live without a car when you are not living in a very big city .
Although prices are lowering , the other ways of travelling are still much more expansive than car .
For instance most of the population who can afford it is going to work driving a car .
It is true that other ways of travelling have been enhanced in cities such as the underground or buses , however car remains the easier and more common way to travel .

Nevetheless , I think there will be some change but concerning how cars work .
Today some people are already working on how make car pollute less through fostering research on other type of fuels made from plants for instance .

To conclude we can say that changes are obviously needed but as far as I am concerned I think it will not be a decrease of the use of cars but an evolution of car themselves .
