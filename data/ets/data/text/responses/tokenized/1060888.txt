I neither disagree or agree the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities for various reasons .

First of all in past times people especially youth has much more spare time compared to present times youth .
Morever the obligations of the youth are much more than the former one , as an example in my country due to economical reasons almost 80 percent of collage undergraduates has to have a lte night job to cover up for his or her collage fee and expenses .
Therefore it is impossible to make a fair comparison betwwen generations .

Secondly , in my country , Turkey , Although the sharing and helpful community of past turkish culture does not seem to exist as it was 15-20 years ago , there has been an significant increase in both quantity of charity unions and their member numbers with comparison .

Moreover , according to my observations , 3 out of 5 people who joins this kind of organizations are mostly in a age range of 18-30 .
they help people with disabilities to adapt the society , arrange a support group for misbehaved children and women , give lectures for poor families children .
Today the community services and charity work are done much more organized compared to way back then .

In conclusion , The conditions of today and past generations are very different than each other .
Altough it may be seen that youth spend less time for helping their communities stillplays significant role
to help it ,
