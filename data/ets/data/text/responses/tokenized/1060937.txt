Someone think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to sprcialize in one specific subject .
In my opinion , But I disagree it .
I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
To have broad knowledge of many academic will cause many negetive results .

firstly , if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you must spend much more time to work hard .
You will hvat to give up many other important things .
You will not have enough time to play sports and your health will be worse .
Otherwise , you will not have enough time to communicate with your family and friends .
You will fell lonely after a long period .

Secondly , even you have spend so many time to work hard and you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects finally .
But probably , you only know some common informations of many academic subjedts and are not good at one special subject .
For example , a physician who know many knowledge of history , computer , plants and so on .
He must have not enough time to study his medical knowledge , so he will not a good physician .
Otherwise , if everyone all have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
In the result , they can do all kinds of job but they can not do them very well .

In a conclusion , I think people should have special knowledge in one specific subject and review broad knowledge of many academic subjects but not spend too much time on them .
Because broad knowledge can give you more idea of your special subject .
