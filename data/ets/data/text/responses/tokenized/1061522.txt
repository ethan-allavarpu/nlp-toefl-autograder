I do agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are produced to promote a product and to make it sell better .
So what do we do if we want people to buy our product ?
We try to tell them that our product is the best choice on the market , which is maybe not true , but people need to believe it to chose our product .
That is the reason why many advertisements make to seem their products much better than they actually are .
In our every day lives we are confronted with many examples .
My favourite example are the washing powder advertisements on television .
Would n't it be wonderful to put your clothes in the washing machine and when taking them out again , all the ugly stains are gone and the clothes look newer than before ?
I have tried several times , but it just does not work .
So there the advertisements definitely make the washing powder much better than it is .
Another product which has to be incredible according to advertisement , are energy bars for sports .
You do not only get an unhuman power and condition , but the bar turns your outer appearance into an athlete 's body .
`` This is much cheaper than the fitness studio '' , I thought and tried .
But again I was disappointed .
Neither did my condition improve , nor did my body shape change .
Disillusioned about advertisements promises I resigned , until recently , when I heard Ovomaltine 's new publicity .
The advertisement of the chocolate powder to flavour your milk , does not claim to make you stronger , but more enduring .
It says : `` Ovomaline - not better , but longer . ''
So this is the one and only exception I have seen in my life , where advertisement does not make a product seem much better than it is .
