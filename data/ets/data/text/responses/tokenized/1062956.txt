All the people pass in different ages of their life , we can find kids , youngs , adults and older and in each part of life people can enjoy their life , but in each part differ from the other by the enjoy of life , where some people says that young people enjoy life more than older people do so it 's true to say that .

For the young people we can see that they enjoy life more than older because they still young new to explore life , so they have new things to see and learn in life and to enjoy it they are free to go everywhere they will have many new opportunities to choose their life to make friends to go out partying to participate in real life where they can join services groups or political groups for example they will share the political life they will have their opinion .
And they will decide what they want to be in their futur life for example an engineer so they will join the university after they will dream about their futur life , and they will really enjoy life when they will love a person they will dreams about making a family .
So they will have many things to enjoy and to share it with others .

In the same time the older people enjoy life in many ways , when they will remember their own life that passed and the things what they did they will see their family growing up and especially they will be happy when they will carry their children 's childrens they will be absolutley enjoying life and the older people will enjoy their life after the retirement they will be free for example to go fishing hunting whatever , in the same time they will have problems but they will still enjoying life with the rest .

Finally , all the young or old people will enjoy their life in differents ways , but we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have many differents ways to enjoy it than older people have .
