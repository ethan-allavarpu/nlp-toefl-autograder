It is often said that there will be no more traffic-jam in the future .
Scientists have been developing a flying car and bigger and faster public transportation vehicle will be developed .
Howevere , I formly disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in next twenty years .
There will be more population than today and there will be many barriers to use those technologies actually .

To begin with , growing the number of population will make the world more complicated and complex and each person will have own car .
Compared with the past , it is true that we have a lot more cars nowadays than the past .
For example , in Seoul , Korea , three of ten had a own car even ten yeas ago .
How about now ?
The percentage of possesion is almost same with the past .
However , the number of cars is five times more than 1990s ' .

In addition , twenty years are not enough time to develop some new technology and actuallly use it .
The government have tried to make new subway system and monorail system within ten years , but the thing was already twenty years ago .
There is no any changes and they have still been planning .
For example , one of the experts from the government said last week , they were planning to adapt new system for aircraft within five years .
The essay for the next day , however , criticized that the government should finish the Airforce-military system changing plan which had not been finished for ages .
Also , it said , `` no more people in this country believe the government ! ''

In conclusion , we all hope that a fewer cars is in the world in the future .
It should be replaced by the great public transportation , such as subway and buses .
Also , government should make the cost of flights much cheaper than now .
However , I do not agree with that there will be a fewer cars in use than now in the next twenty years with all these reasons .
