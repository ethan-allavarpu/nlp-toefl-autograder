I agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Here are my reasons : More and more people concern about the polluted problem of environment , and not only government decides to pass bills that can protect our nature environment , but also people reduce the damage to our environment .
And cars are one of vital damage to these pollution , because they release carbon dioxide .
If people reduce to drive cars by themselves , instead , use the mass transportation , the amount of carbon dioxide , which is a vital reseason that cause pollutions can be eliminated .
So I think cars will be fewer than today .

Second , cities are developed grauatedly , more and more cities will have their mass transportation , such as MRT , trains , or buses .
These useful development can provide a more ecnomical way to transport for citizens .
In order to save money and priceless time , people will choose to use mass transportation rather than drive cars by themselves .
For example , although many teachers of mine have their own cars , but they only drive cars by themselves in rainy days .
Because the MRT in our city provides a cheaper and comfortable journey for us .
And they do n't need to drive .

In addition , the expenditure to maintain a car is very big .
For example , the expenditure of gasoline , the tax of cars , etc .
This huge expenditure would effect the willing of people having a car .

Finally , crowed traffic situation would also make people do not want drive car by themselves .
And there is still a big problem to drivers : finding a parking space is extremely hard .

To sum up , the idea of environmental protection , more conveinent mass transportation , the expenditure of having a car , to avoid stuck in a traffic jam , worry about how to find a parking space on time , all of these considerations would make fewer and fewer people to plan to have their own cars .
