I disagree with the argument that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
Actually , it might be helpful to have many knowledge but objectively , that is unnccessary than to specialize in one specific subject .
anybody have many other knowledges by useing some times .
but if to specialize in one specific subject .
than you will get more specific knowledge that other people do not know about it .
it is more useful to have the knowledge .
for example , let say you are the owner of the company and you want to hire some one for marketing section and there are two people who went just a university and aother went a specific business college .
who do you going to hire for your business ?
I am not saying that the just university person is bad but , objectively , I will hire the specific business college .
because I want the person who have a idea of a specific section , which is business and who have lots of knowledge at the field .
and not only my question but also the real world is like that .
There are lots of people who are achieve at their field such as CEO of Microsoft , not only he was good at but also he was ti soecializ in one specific subject .
may be to have broad knowledgeof many academic subjects will helps you to decide your field but if you have your goal alraedy than i suggest that to have knowledge in one thing .
and eventhought you think it is waste fo time but do not stop .
because no body will going to have that your effort and you will get the golden age for your appreciate .
