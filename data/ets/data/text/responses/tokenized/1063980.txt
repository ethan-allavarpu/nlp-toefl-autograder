Do youing people enjoy more than older epole , that is a very diffivult question , taking in accoubt that most peole would think that young people might have more fun than older peole , just because they think that they are healthier , faster , stronger , as my mom used to tell me , teenagers think they are suoperman , they take risks that older peole normally wouldnt takem , thety stay up all nioght , go to parties , drive fast carsm , and maybe even do illegal drugs , but that does not mean that young people has more fun , i once read a very good book `` Tuesdays with Morrie '' . its a book about life , it shows the experiences of a young man , interacting with an elder , the elder has gone through various experiences , and the youngster wants to learn from thoe sxperiences , and eventually , the teacher tells him one thing , `` you first need to learn how to die , thenm you can learn how to live ... '' that tells the student that he has to absorb all that he canm from his experiences , and then let go of some of his emotions and then , he can know how it feels to taste succes , or love , and even pride .
Morrie , who is the teacher on the book tells the main caharcter that once you know how if feels how to die , yopu know how to live because you learn how to enjoy life even more .
the point i am trying to make is that older people know how to take more and more from each new experience , and they probably enjoy life even more , although there are a few exceptions , some young people are evry mature and find a way to have fun even in the worst cituatuions , like people that dont have as many economic resources , they learn how to take advantage from the few oportunities they have to go out , or party as we say nowadays .
i honestly think that older people have mopre fun , because they have learned how to enjoy life , and young people are just living at a hundred miles an hour , trying to do too many things to have fun , and not getting a lot out of the experinces that they6 go through in their daily lifes .
