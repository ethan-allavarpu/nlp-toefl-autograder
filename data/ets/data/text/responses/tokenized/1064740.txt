I agree with the statement and I do think understanding ideas and concepts is really important for students .
And I have three reasons .

First , it 's quite necessary to understand the ideas and knowledge when students first learn them .
In this way they learn more effectively than simply memorize the facts we come across .
Also , a good understanding of the knowledge would help students recall what they learned before .
If the study is all about reciting and memorizing , there would be not a better student than a computer .

Second , as my teachers always told me that students should learn `` how to learn '' , rather than gain the knowledge only .
And believe that 's the real purpose of education , to teach the student how to think and solve new problems they will meet in the future .
My high school could be a bad example .
When I studied there , although my teathers told me it was important to know how to learn , cared too much about memorizing .
It was indicated in the exams .
In order to get a good mark of the examinations , all we should do is to copy the facts into our minds .
What 's worse , the process of study was so fast that we could n't have time to have a good thinking about the ideas .
As a result , I only can remember a few of the things I learned from the high school textbooks now .

In addition , to understand and take a deeper thinking of what we learn is the way how we 've developed our cultures from the very beginning !
It 's the way we gain the knowledge from the people before and create new ideas of our own .
Image if all the students do n't learn how to understand and how to thinking deeply , how would be the future society like ? !

In a word , the way I see it , it 's not only important but also fairly necessary for students to understand ideas and think more about what they learn .
