The following essay describes why I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisments play a tremendous role in our lives .
Let me first state my personal feelings about the situation in our society today .
I am often irritated and confused when I see all the different advertisements .
When I turn on the TV , read the daily newspaper or even when I go outside for a run in the park I am influenced by advertisements .
Everywhere in the media and in the public are advertisments and people are oversupplied and do not recognize them anymore .
Therefore in order to gain the attention of the consumers the companies have to exaggerate in the advertisements .
They praise their products extremely in order to be recognized by the people .
The competition is very hard due to the huge variety of products .
The increasing significance of communication channels like the internet make the competition even harder because people are now penetrated even more with advertisements and commercials .
Only if the advertisement is extraordinary and special people will eventually buy the product .
However , in reality the product ist not as good as the advertisment has promised .
I have also been dissapointed by a product that I bought for several times .
One example is the new iPhone which promises to be much better than it really is .
However that is a very subjective impression because other people like the product and are satisfied .
As a conclusion one can say that the attitude of a product is a very personal feeling and differs a lot .
