I desagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have several reasons why I think so .
First , travel lad by a tour guide is titely scheduled so you are not allowed to spend time freely .
As a result of it , you can not experience the real life of the people who live in the place you visit .
Tour guides show you only what they want you to see .
There are many other places you should visit to understand local peoples life .
For example , the houses they actually live or parks local children gather in , not the places such as famous temples or historic buildings .

Second , it is better to travel alone than being in a group .
To travel with your friends may make you feel relaxed , but , especially in the case of going abroad , you can learn how to deal with troubles by yourself .
It will make you tough and much more self-confident .
It is true that traveling in a group led by a tour guide banefit you much in terms of seculty and safety , but one of the most important things you can learn from traveling is to acquire the ability to handle the problem even if you are in a strange place .

Third , traveling in a group led by aguid tour is passive .
If you go abroad , it is bettter to study the language that local people speak .
Language can not be separated from calture so in you would really like to understand its culture , you need to learn their language too .
