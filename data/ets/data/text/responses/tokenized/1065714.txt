I 'm not sure of this statement , I known a lot 40 years old more sad than older people .
To make an example , my grandfather is 70 years old and he still enjoy life going around the world two times a year .

I like his love for life , and I hope I 'll have the same because if you do n't enjoy the life you should spend all the time sad and it is n't a good thing .

I do n't think that the age is so important to determin the love for life .
Logically a young people can have more from the life than an old people if the speech is about the physics activity ; I can stay all night long or do many kilometers by bycicles .
things that an old people ca n't do .
But as I wrote before is closed to the physician charateristic .

The problem are that many young boy do n't ejoy life and I ca n't understand why .
Too people in this time are sad maybe for the stress the fast of life-style that is concentrated only on work and stupid thinghs that you have to had to be similar to the other people .

I think that the statement is too restrictive , we ca n't say surely the young people are more attracted by life than old people because is not always true .
Another example is about a professor who theaced me few years ago , he was not young however his behavior were like the behavior of a young boy : his vitality and his capacity to relate with my classmate ( young boy ) .
luckly the people who go out with me are full of vitality , so I never spend my time boring myself like other people do .
I say this becouse I know a lot of people who seems afraid of life and stay at home all the time watching tv while out the sun is bright .
