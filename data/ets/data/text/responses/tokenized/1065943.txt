Imagne one situation : you are sleeping well on your warm bed and you are dreaming kissing someone you admired , however all the romantic stopped by a sequence of loud knocking to tell you wake up and go for a trip .
What is your response ?
Terrible , please send to me the hell !
On my point of view , I think it is rediculous to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

The situation is one of the problems .
I am a lazy guy and I really want to have appointment with my lover in my dream , however , you disturb it and ask me to go travelling !
The members of a group are divers , as a consequnce , it is hard to set a time good for everyone .
When the tour guide waked the members up , perhraps some guys felt unwilling to get up to go .
This will not only make the group tired and also make them unhappy .

The situation is not the only problems .
If we are forming a group , that means we can not go separetly .
We are just like small children following our teather ( tour guide ) to travel .
It is inconvinent for the group members and may lose some beauty .
Just think I found somewhere really beautiful but the tour guide said they are not in the plan !
How can I do ?
Can I jump out of the group ?
No .

Those two situation almost drive the group members crazy , but the worst is still to come !
The tour guide become the dominant of the group .
How bad ?
Bloody bad .
Without that guy , we can do nothing but sleeping and waiting .
That means if the tour guide want us to go some places that we do not intereting , we should go because our `` king '' ask us to go !
All of group members must listen to the tour guide or they will be cast away .

All the things happened on the way of the travelling is suffer for all of the group members .
What I learn from the just referred situation that drive the poor group members crazy is that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .
