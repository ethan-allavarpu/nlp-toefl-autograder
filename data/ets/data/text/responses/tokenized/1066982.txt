I partially agree with this statement .
I think that having a broad and wide knowledge is a really good thing : if you are open minded and can discuss about many topics , you can get many opportunities , and you can also have more immunity to market variations .
For instance , in case of macro-economic problems in a certain productive area , you can be able to change your work more freely , and more rapidly respect to the ones which are very deeply specialized .
Otherwise , workers ( and here I refere also to managers , and people who have great responsabilities ) also need to be specialized in a certain field .
According to my opinion and to my knowledge , today the market needs people who are specialized , but also needs people who can share their knowledge with their colleagues , in order to obtain revenues by sinergy and cooperation practices ; for this reason I think that while you are a student you need to widen as much as possible the spectrum of you knowlegde , investigating as many fields as possible ; according to me , it is reasonable to improve a specific tecnical ability just after finishing your studies ( or during the last year of your academic career ) ; behaving in such a way , you could have both the basic wide knowledge to effort changes , and also the specialization , which could make you the best worker in a certain field at a certain time and in a certain region .
For example , workers with a low istruction level , may have many problems in case of changes in the strategy of their company , or ( and this is a more dramatical problem for workers involved in the process ) in case of market revolutions , which make a certain product obsolete , or generate the so called `` killers applications '' .
So , in order to be an attractive worker for the labour market , you need to specialize your knowledge , but in order to minimize risks , and to avoid market changes , you have to widen your knowledge ; you also need to improve your capabilities and knowledge after you have finished your studies : this is the so called `` life long learning '' , which I believe is the best model in modern society .
