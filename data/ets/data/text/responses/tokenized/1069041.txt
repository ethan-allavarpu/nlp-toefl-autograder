Of course , students have to learn facts from teachers and memolize them .
However , it is only a first step to proceed their study .
They should spend most of time to figure out ideas and concepts .
By doing this , they can acquire appication skills .
Moreover , they can enjoy their studies .

To begin with , they can get highly developed appication skills if they try to understand matters .
You will agree with this idea : person who knows the nature of matter can perform well when he works on new problems , rather than person who only memolized surface of the matter .
They can applicate their ideas if they know the matter deeply .
Now , it is often said that Japanese lack the appication skill .
We are ranked in a lower position when the research is out .
In contrast , countries , like US , are ranked higly every time .
We know the cause of this situation .
The education of Japan higly emphasizes memolizing .
We must take hard entrance examination when we enroll in high school and university .
So , although we often memolize the facts , we seldom have opportunity to think the matter deeply .
So , students can raise their appication skill by understanding the concept itself .

Second , understanding the nature of problems is much more attractive for students .
They can get pleasure when they find out the solution or they could understand the concept .
Therefore , they can continue studying with joyful .
We want to do what we like rather than dislike .
It also helps raising their accademic skills .
In contrast , in case of learing all things , they will stop studying .
For me personally , I did n't like studying at all until I entered university .
I could not find joy in studying because I had to memolize many facts .
However , almost all studies in universities assign us to think by ourselves .
Now , studying is not disconfort .

Because of the application skills and joyment , I believe students should concentrate on understanding .
They can raise their ability and become interested in studying more .
