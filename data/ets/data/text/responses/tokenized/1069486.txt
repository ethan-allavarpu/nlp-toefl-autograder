To answer this question it is important to figure out the reasons why young people support their community .
Mostly the younger people join groups to have people around to enjoy the time with friends .
This can happen in the church community , sport clubs or just for hanging loose .
Especially activities in church try to teach the younger ones how important it is to e.g. help people with disabillities .
But because of the increase of the media consumption , especially TV , community activities are being told to be `` uncool '' .
It is more important to be individual and gain your own popularity .
Another reason can be that people loose trust in their government .
They feel the pressure which lasts on them if they want to have success in their life .
So they try to get the best for their own advance .
As well when the people recognise that government members who should serve the public think it is more important to fill their own pockets .
This can have the effect that people turn to be more egoistic .
Especially because of the new information era the people are aware of the selfishness of some government members .
As well they are told about the risks in life every day in the news .
I think this constant pressure and the lack of honesty has lead to the point that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
But with the society being aware of that matter , chances ar not bad that a new way of thinking and acting can be taught .
So you can see a lot of effort being taken from media and government to emphasize this problem and to point out how important it is to serve the community .
Hopefullly this will lead modern societies to a turning point where serving is something good an has not to be `` uncool '' .
