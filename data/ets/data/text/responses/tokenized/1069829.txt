I am disagreeing with this statement .
According to my own personal experience I think that specializing on one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I am an electronics engineer and the electronics is a very broad subject you can not learn everything on every subject

First of all if you can not pick a subject than in the future time there can be some instabilities on your knowledge because you are not focused on one subject , the knowedge you have from other subjects can misguide you in one specific thing .
But if you are specialized in one subject than you know all the basics and important parts of that subject and you become the person that is required for that specific topic at everywhere you go .
As an example , my major is Robotics and Control so I am very experienced in that topic and when there is a problem with control systems in the factory , I can easily go and understand the problem and provide a solution as fast as possible .
But if I was not specialized in any topic , than I would have to analyze the problem , do some research to increase my knowledge at the same time trying to get over with the confusion in my mind from the knowledge of other topics in my head and than try to solve the problem .
This will take longer time and I guess it wo n't be that effective .
Most of the companies today are based on time effectiveness and they ca n't wait for you to increase your knowledge for the job that assigned to you .

Secondly , when you have broad knowledge of many academic subject , it is harder for you to show your eligence to the people such as they will ask you like what is your area of specializition and if you say I have a broad knowledge on many subjects most probably they wo n't accept you because today the team work is the key point to the success , nobody needs a person that say I have a very broad knowledge , I can do everything required on my own , I do n't need somebody else .
You can not compete yourself with a team with mix of specialized knowledges about the topics that are related to them .

In brief , I think it is important to specialize in one specific topic .
By this you can work in any team and with the mix of this specialized knowledges the team work is the best way to provide solutions to the problems .
Today at every company the teams are providing solutions and conducting researches and nobody on his own can provide much .
