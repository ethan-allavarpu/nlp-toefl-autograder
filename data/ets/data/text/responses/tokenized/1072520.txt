I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks to achieve thier goals .
Only if there are risks the life will be more interesting .
And also if we work on the same things we will feel bored .
For example if a software engineer works on a same project for several years then there will be no improvement in his techical skills or i will actually lose his imagination power .
Only if he works in differnt scenarios he can improve his own and knowledge and gain experience

`` Mukesh Ambani '' is the best example i think because first he is a successful person in variuos kinds of business .
First along with his brother he started industries and developed those industries to gain more profit .
Then he started oil refineries and then comes the reliance mobiles .
Apart from this reliance energy resourses are doing a great job in the mutual funds and share markets .

This also helps to provide job for people in different fields .
If there is only one industry then we can support only the people who are in that field .
By trying new business also helps to reduce unemployment and to develop various economic level .

Another one reason of doing variuos business is if there is loss in one of the business we can manage the lose because of the profit in other business .
In case we are doing a one business then we can not manage that situation .
Eg .
Learning both hardware and software will help when there is less number of jobs available in software or hardware .
So if we learn more and keep you update to date with the new technologies then there is no way for loss .

May be there are successful people who does the same which they know ( same bussiness ) but the probablity is very less .
Trying new things and developing the new skill sets will give us in good position
