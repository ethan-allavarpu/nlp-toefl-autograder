My opinion about the having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better tahn the speciallizing i one specific subject is that broad knowledge is much better for our study than the one specific subject , which reasons include that broad knowledge could open our horizen about the whole study and we could have wider rangesfor us to choose our majors through studying broad knowledge .

In morden time , many jobs need various knowlege because the matters require complete abilities and broad knowledge which contents many academic sujects , such as math , physics and chemsitry could provide a broader knowledge for us which one specific subject could not .
For example , If we are a lawyer , we not only use the knowledge about the law , we still need the knowledge about the ecnormy and humannity .
We would benifity from broader knowlwdge in our work .
It provides us more information when we should solve a problem .

Furthermore , we would choose our major from what we learned in the school and studying broad subjects widern the range for us to choose .
What I meet now is that which major I should choose .
Though I have already studied some subjects , I still do not figure out which major suits me best .
This is an important aspect because I should use the knowlege about my major after graduation and I would earn money by working this field .
If I choose the wrong major because of lacking interests and unabble to study , I could not rasies myself in the future .
Broad knowledge makes me confortable to chosse the one I like best and study my major well .

To sum up , though one specific subject is a skill for cerntain people to use like painte , I still draw the conclution that broad knowledge is better than one specific subject .

Time to sleep , bye .
