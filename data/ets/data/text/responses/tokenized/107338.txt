According to risk taking there are two types of people ; one of which hates taking any kind of risky attempt and the other is ready in orderto try new things and take risks .
According to my oppinion people should be enough courages to take risks so that they could make inventions , innovations and businesses .

New foundations , inventions are born from the risk taking attemps .
Today we are in the space era thanks to those risky ideas and doings .
When we think about humanbeings first space travel .
The possiblity of returning alive is not much . .
Full of risk gave its result so that new space station s cqan be establishedd .
there can not be any scientists who could make his invention without trying risky experiments .
Edison could invent electric after his unlimited number of unsuccessful experiments .
He sacrified much in terms of risks attemps

Additionally in the bussiness life we see that the firms could be established with a risk involment .
Noione can predict whether or not his firm will make money or not .
But there are many examples of bussiness men who began the entreprise with bank credits or loans with higher interest rates which means that he must earn with a higher rate .
this is also risk taking .
What is done to start and even to run a new firm .
is also risk taking .
Without risktaking nothing new can not be founded .

In brief in order to achive new thing like inventions and to make bussiness the very first need is risk taking ability .
we are living in space era because of the risks taken .
There exist firms thank to risk taking idea
