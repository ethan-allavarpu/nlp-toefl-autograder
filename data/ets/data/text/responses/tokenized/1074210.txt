It is difficult to say whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject .
First I will say that it is important to have a broad knowledge .
But then I will show that it is not easy or even possible to do .

Having a broad knowledge is very good .
This is why , at school I have learn about a lot of different topics .
To know as good about history as about biology or astronomy is fantastic .
If I had this broad knowledge I would be able to speak with a biologist or an historian .
But it is possible to have a broad knowledge of many academis subjects without being specialized in one particular topic ?

In fact , my knowledge in biology would not be as accurate as this of a biologist .
That is to say that , somebody who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , is specialized in nothing .
So , in that case it is hard or even imposs to find a job .
I think it is important to specialize in one specific subject in order to find a job , or to be able to provide accurate information about a precise topic .

In conclusion , In my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
But in that case it is important too , not to forget that other subjet exist .
So , it is necessary to read books about other topics .
For example a biologist must Know about history even if he will never be as good in history as in biology because the may need historical information to explain several phenomenons that he is already studying .
