Let 's define what we heard by young and older person .
For me a young person is typically a students .
On the contrary an older person will be someone who have accomplished his professionnal carrier .

First , we will try to define how young people enjoy their lifes .
I am convinced that a students try to experience lots of things .
It is said that it is the better age to travel .
In fact young person do not need a great confort to travel .
Moreover the connection with their parents begins to break .
They have not really lots of things which can make them stay in the same place .
So that is right , they really have all arguments to travel , discover new countries , coutums and civilisations .
But is it really enjoying life .
It is sure that it is easier for them to travel but are they mature enough to keep in mind their experience .
They certainly hqve not the same approach their parents would have by visiting new countries .

It is also important for them to experience new things like being responsable , have a budget to conserve .
Those things can inhibit their lifes .

Then we will discrib what can be the life for an older person .
If this person is healthy enough I assume that it is the best period .
Your children have finished their studies , you manage to educate them .
You can endly enjoy your life and have profits of your years of professional activity .
Traveling , taking time to cook , making sports , taking parts in associassions .
In fact you have time for doing what you want .
In the one hand you have lots of time but in the other hand you have not .
Certainly you had established lots of things to do but it is hard to manage to do all .
Usually the question is also Am I still able to do this ?

To conclude I would say that older people may more enjoy their lifes .
Principally it depends on their health .
It is sure they will be fastly tired but they have their experiences to choose essential things to do .
Younger person do not have this experience but are working on it by trying to enjoy the most they can their lifes .
