In this world full of selfish , helping the others turns to be a way of life for many people , and a great number of them are young .

Despite the generalized idea of the young boy drinking during all the weekend , having as many fun as he can , in my opinion , there are a pretty important number of young people that thinks in the others , in their communities .

Nowadays , it is welll known that , we have a great problem , at least in Spain , with the young people and their motivations in life .
But , there are also , a lot of people with strong principles , who enjoy expressing themselves in strikes , forum , etc .
There are people who take part of different sort of Non Gubernamental Organitations , for which they spend most of their free time .

Moreover , it is possible to see people cleaning the forests during the weekend , helping in the hospitals , being volunteer in local campaigns for the adaptation and the integration of foreign people .

The Non Gubernamental Organisations have changed the way of working in human rights field , by the introducing of the figure of the volunteer .
A volunteer use to be a young person who wants to participate more activetly in the lifes of their neighbours .
It is a person who cares about things like , the environment , the climate , the human rights , the animals , the globalisation , summarizing , their communities .

The truth is that many people is concerned about how the things are going , how everything is developing , and among them , the young peolpe .
Despite all the wars , and destruction , the world is full of people that truly relief in a better world .
I think that we are many reasons to be proud of our young people , because they will be able to go , further than our generation , with all their purposes of a better world .
