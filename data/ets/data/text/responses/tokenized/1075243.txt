Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I agree with this statement young are enegetic and have the curiosity to enjoy and accomplish things .
Young people will have good friends , they spare good amount of time with friends , going on vacations , partying in the weekends and lot more .
While old people contacts will be very less they only enjoy certain times , like if any relative come to your house .

First of all , young people study in universities , in universities they not only study but involve in so many recreational activities ...
Environment of the university will be very good , they enjoy in canteens with many friends .
Where old people does't have the chance .

Secondly , youngsters will be energetic and enjoy a lot by participating in games like playing shuttle , cricket .
Other than their amusement they can keep their health fit .

In good communities , there may be social organisations in the month end .
Young people participate in these social organizations and may arrange large events like conducting games , providing orchestra etc .
In games young people participate largely and try to entertain other people in the social organization .

Universities will give long vacations in the year end , which will have good chance for the youngsters to plan and spend lots of time enjoy themselves during their vacations .
They can go to other places to see their relatives and find some time spend with their relatives .
Yougsters have the propensity to spend time by watching movies , these movies are interesting and enjoy them selves .

Taking into account of all these factors , youngsters will enjoy lot more than the older people becase the environment hey have in the community .
