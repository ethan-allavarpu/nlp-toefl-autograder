I am happy .
I am young , and I am happy .
I never been old in my life so I can not know if I agree or disagree whit the statement , basing myself on my own life experience .
But I do can answer basing on what I live since this time and on what I seen around me during this time .
And I will say that I agree .

Their is a lot of avantages in getting older .
Older people have more freedom ( they can do whatever they wanted to and do not have to ask anyone ) , they earn their life in their own so they are able to plan it better than a young people because they do not have to rely onto their parents . ..
But I am still thinking that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Their is just much more things to do , things to enjoy , for young people .
They do not have as much responsabilities than older people , so they do not have as much things to worry about .
For example , I said that older people have more freedom , earning their own life .
It is thrue .
But what I did not say then , it is that their is more fun , to me , in enjoying life basicly , without any trouble in mind , or much less importants ones .

Furthemore , young people have often much more possibilities to meet new people and make new friends than older ones .
Older people have to have a job to earn their life .
And most of time , after the fisrt weeks im their compagny , they will see the same people , collegues , maybe for the rest of their life .
A young people , doing his studies , meets a lot of new people each year when he comes to a new class .
He could even meets more new people if he changes of university .

So young people meet more people , make more friends , have more fun , and have less problems to worry about . ..
Well , I am also exciting to getting older and have more freedom and responsability every day , but I think that I may regrets these years one day ,
