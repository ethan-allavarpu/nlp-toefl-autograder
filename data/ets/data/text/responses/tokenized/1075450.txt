There has been an argument about which is better ; having broad understanding in many topics or specialized knowledge in one specific subject .
When it comes to academic subjects , I think that specialization is essential because of following reasons .

Almost all areas of knowledge require professional specialists to handle and develope them because they are very complicated nowadays .
It is true that our society needs generalists who have wide range of knowledge , but generalists ' knowledge is based on the specialists ' works in each area .
It is specialists who make a new discovery and produce knowledge , having the ability to perform sound researchs on each specific subject .
That 's why I assert that specialists ' role is primary .

Moreover , having broad knowledge is an easy job for everyone because sharing information is easier than ever before .
We can easily search for the lastest knowledge in books and internet .
This makes the generalists ' role unsignificant to be a generalist especially in these days .
