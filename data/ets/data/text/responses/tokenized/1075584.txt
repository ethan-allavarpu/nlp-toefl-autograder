In my definition the enjoyment of life is living life to its fullest .
And thus , i believe that young people enjoy more life than older people .
There are various points with me to discuss this issue .

Firstly , young people are mobile .
In other words , they are young mind , young blood with dynamic energy .
If some one is mobile he can reach any where to satisfy his need to live life and make it at its full wihtout any compromise .
Whereas olders are at the age at which they have atleast one problem , which makes them immobile .
At this age they are out of energy and liable to have atleast one health problem , makes them to stay at home and dependent .

secondly , young people are doing atleast one task like studying , job etc. and this makes them to come in touch with lots of people and new friends .
This gives them the opportunity to makes new friends , with whom they can enjoy life by week ends , long drives etc. on ohter hand the olders are handicap in this regards .
since they are compromised through health .
which makes them to seat at home and alone with his health .
So , no health , no going out , no friends and no enjoyments of life .

Moreover , In other words young people are twenty first century people .
Young people utilizes all the latest technology by gaining its knowledge though the reliable sources , since they are intellignet enough to utilise it and convert it in to the new source on enjoyment of life .
On other hand the older people still have the older mind setup which is out dated enough for the enjoyment of life .

In conclusion , the younger people do have the enough energy , chance to make friends and adequate knowledge to live life at its fullest , which olders lack in .
