A lot of people always ask : `` would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject '' , and I always base my answer in my personal opinion to answer yes .
I answer with a yes because if I have knowledge in many academemic subjects , I will have more options to find a job .
I say is important to have knowledge in many subjetcs because the live in every country is different .
The life is like fill with stones where you need to be prepare to move to do not fall .

I am a high school student hopping to get accepted in a university .
I want to major in physics .
I do not know if I will be able to find a job when I finish college , but I am sure the most I know , the more opportunities I will have to find a job .
In the life is necessary to know a little bit of anything .

This is simple .
I am from Ecuador , and in my country the life is very difficult .
If I have knowledge in a specific subjet , I am no going to have any money to live like a normal person , this means , I can not pay for my food , I can not pay a place to live , and I can not pay my studies .

The life has stones .
If I am invited to a important phisics meeting , I would know I am going to participate in the meeting , but what will happen if somebody ask me something different than physics , and I do not have an answer .
I will be remember that pour situation for years and I do not want that .

Finally , if for any reasons that happen , that would encourage me to study more and more .
