In my opinnion , successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

I regard this statement as true because I have a quite different definition of success .

If somebody is really successful , he/she should not only manage something that he/she is supposed to do but she should always improve his/herself and have an aim to make innovations by the means of self-optimisation .
This has a vital role on someone 's career because it would help the person to be realised by other others and promote .

On the other hand I do n't state that should always take risks and alter the ways he/she knows .
The time and the place that a person would try new things and take some risks is also very important .
If it is a wrong time or place the things can get worse and worse .

For example if your boss gives you an important project that should be prepared soon you should n't take a risk at this situation and you also do n't have the right to do that because you can harm the prestige of the company which you 're working in .

To conclude , I think that one should try new things and take risks after gaining some experiences and feel ready about changes which would make a person sucessfull and admired .
