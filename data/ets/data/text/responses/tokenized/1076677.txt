I partially agree with the given statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' because young people enjoy life by playing with the friends , by watching latest movies , by going to colleges , by teasing the younger people etc . .
where as the older people enjoy life be sitting at home , chatting with the people surrounding , going to piligrim places etc . .

The younger people now a days had a lot of fun life to have for example if we consider the case of my brother he enjoys a lot .
he goes to college on bike , he meet friends every day evening , he will have a big chat with them about movies , he then go to his classmates house to have a fun time with them about the funny things happened on that day , finally he comes to home have a good meal and then he goes to sleep .

If we take the case of the older people they have work to be done , for example if we the case of my grand mother she is quite relaxed , she use to gather the other people and she start chatting the whole day it is a kind entertainment for her , she watch old devotional movies with them enjoy feeling about god , some times she used to go to piligrim places like tirupathi , shirdi etc . .
she use to eat the the she interested , she used to spend money as she wishes .

I think both the younger people and the older people both enjoy life very much but not compared to each other they enjoy in their own way according to their age .
If we consider the real time facts to better understand of this concept we just consider a normal teen age person who used to go to collede or some other jobs they lead their life in luxurious way thinking that this is the age which is not going to come similarly way if we consider the life the older people they just wanted to enjoy their life in the end days so they enjoy their life as they like and also other people of the will cooperate for that .

so i partially agree with the given stat
