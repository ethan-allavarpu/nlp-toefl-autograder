In today 's world , people should know everthing for a better life .
For instance a manager have to know advertising and also has knowledge of account in order to be an effective one .

As far as I 'm concerned , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are many advantages and disadvantages of having broad knowledge of many subjects .
However , I want to explain its advantages because it is more heavier than other .

First of all , knowledge does not make a damage to brain .
It is always usefull for example I am a math teacher nonetheless , I have many hobbies like painting .
I went courses on this topic drawing or colors .
My friend meets me to an exebition a result of this this knowledge about painting gets me an advantage such as having entellectual knowledge .

Secondly , life is so complex and full of tasks as a result of this , every time in our life we need kinds of knowledge .
Consequently , it makes our life easier .
I want to explain this with an example .
For instance , I am a student and in my daily life I do n't need the knowledge of economy suh as interest rates but on the other hand when I want to be a cashier in a bank , the manager of the bank ask me while I apply for the job that do you know what the interest rate and how it is counted and how it changes the amount of money .
Thus , I have no cahnce , I have to know that if I want this job .
Consequently , it makes my life easier such as so as to attend a job for earning money .

Most important of all , people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are always acheivers .
For instance , I read Einstein 's life one week ago and understood that Einstein was one of these kinds of people .
He had wide range of knowledge about everthing such as science and also maths .
This knowledge made him in order to establish new scientifical research .

All in all , having knowledge of many subjects make our life easier and also make us happier at the same time making succesfull .
