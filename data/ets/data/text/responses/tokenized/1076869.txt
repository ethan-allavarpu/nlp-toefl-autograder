I am of the opinion that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are many reasons and examples that i would like to list in support of my position .

First let us consider those cases in which the author 's contensions , in fact my contensions , hold good .
Firstly let us consider the field of science and technology .
consider for example a biology student is faced with the problem of replacing the burned out fuse .
If he do not have any knowledge about the electrical subject he may not be able to fix a very simple task .

Also a student of technology should have minimum idea of what medicine to take when a minor health problem arise .
So a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary .

Secondly , if for example a student is confined to study only the history of his own country which is his specific academic subject then he may face problem when asked about the world history and some important events in the world history .

Thirdly , consider the example of desiging a computer .
many people who do different tasks are involved in desiging a computer .
if the person who designs a part of the computer do not understand the funtions of other parts and the link between those parts then a computer can not be designed .

Finally , also a person of sceince or technology may find difficulty in the bussiness world if he do not anything about the stock market .
This can be extended even to politics .
If the party members have idea only about their own party then they are at risk of losing their position if they do not have the knowlede about the other parties .

In sum , I would like to reiterate that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acdemic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject which helps an individual enhance his general knowledge in addition to the regular subject .
