Advertisements are really needed for products , but extravagant publicity is to be militated .
I agree with the following statement that Most advertisements make products seem much better than they are .
firstly , advertiments should provide infomation that a product has .
i mean the quality of the product ( whether it has reliability and garuntee ) .
The advertisors using some showy labels , packings etc. , should stop .
because they charge even for the packings which are expensive , ordinary people cant buy those things even they are daily house hold products which are necessary .
secondly they use some celebrites for canvassing the product , they offer even some royalty from commodity sales percentage .
thirdly , the advertisor attract the consumers , using graphic design and animation by showing them more fascinating than they really are .
These kind of things really going to work on children for and makes there parents to buy for them .
And dazziling stickers also makes them more attracting .
all these will definetly increase the cost of commodity so i finally conclude these kind of avertisements , imean , iagree with the quote that `` most adertisments make products seem much better than they really are . ''
