The New Things
I agree if you try new things and take more risk you can achieve your goals and earn big moneys .
I am talking abaout money because my major is a international trade in my university and i would like to do this business buying an d selling somethings .
I know how to do this job but i think trying new things for instance you can buy another product and you can change it and sell .
It has more risk , may be you can not sell cahanged product .

Successfull people in my country always trying new things for their goal .
They are sometimes loosing but if they win , they would have more profit .
For example , Its a biggest turkish company .
First its a shoe company , they produce shoes and export it .
They know how to do well shoes .
One day the owner who has a company tried another things they sell all of his property ( his factory , his business , his car , etc . )
And he bought a land for produce onion .
He doesnt know anything about how to produce onion , how to sell . ?
ts like a gambling .
He found a farmer who is living in a rural place .
He helped to produce onion and selling process .
And they found small packages for onions .
For example 1pound , 3 pounds packages and they sold directly markets .
It makes more profitable and more usefull for consumers .
And he has a onion brand name .
Now the ex shoe producer has a big onion 's farms and he earns 1 billion dollar a year , he is exporting onions all over the world its a big deal .

In my opinion trying new things and take a risks are not good for everyone because you need a little bit good luck in your business life .
