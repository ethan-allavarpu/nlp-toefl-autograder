I think a basic knowledge is necessary , but in my oppinion our society needs more people who are familliar with one specific subject .
Having broad knowlege does not necessarily helps you to solve a specific problem .
In my home country for example , there are many people who can handle a computer , but there are only a few who have enough knowledge to deal with certain problems on their own .
That 's one reason why many computerfirms hirer people from countries like India .
This situation is not so good for our inhabitants , because often they do not get a job .

This is only one example for why specialization has advantages for the economy of a country .
There is no doubt on that employees need a broad knowledge to be flexible , if they for example lose their job , which is a great problem in our country .
But I think , if there are experts for almost every area , a country 's economy has many advantages , altough it is very risky for the inhabitants to specialize , because they may get no job in their specific academic subject .

But as I said , there are many advantages which support the idea of specialize in one specific area .
But it shoulb be regarded what size and capacity the firm has .
A big company has many employees and so each employee can handle a problem on his own .
If he need to know anything about an other subject he can ask an other expert for help .
So with the help of teamwork they can nearly solve every problem .
In smaller businesses this looks a bit different , because small firms can not afford so many employees .
So for smaller businesses it is better to have a broad knowledge , so that you can solve many different problems .
