At first glance it seems to be a baffling question but if you 'll take a closer look you might reckon to say that this subject needs to be examined .
This esssay deals with a broad description of why it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

First of all I would like to say that it is indispensable for any kind of student to broaden his knowledge .
Let us assume that you earned your Bachelor 's degree in sports and that you would like to get some overseas working experience .
Due to the fact that you attended a univerity that did n't allow you to learn a foreign language it wo n't be possible for you to fully indulge in new surroundings .

Furthermore you can just work in a small working field that does n't allow you obtain more responsibility .
I am quite sure that you will soon feel uncomfortable and that you might regret that you did n't take the opportunity to broaden your academic skills .
Rome was not build in a day and it is quite apparent that you can hardly obtain more knowledge from one day to another .

If those students who just focussed on a specific subject , such as sports , attended different classes , besides their major , it would be easier for them to survive in the capitalistic world .

I am trying to reinforce my point of view with a quotation of Darwin . ''
The survival of the fittest '' , expresses a fact , based on several incidents that took place in the early 19th century .
You can easily link it to our assigment .

Thus , what happens to those students who attended business classes besides their normal major .
Let us assume that they have learned how to plan tasks and how to meet their targets via shedules and agendas .
Maybe these business classes taught them how to control people via '' carrot and stick '' or through normal philanthroposy .

These skills would truly broaden their possibilities to apply for other jobs , such as managing sports events or leading an enterprise in the fields of sports .
I am pretty sure that everybody takes advantage of a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , as I 've examined in the lines above .
I grew up with the belief that a person never truly finishes his education and that there is something new to learn with each day .
Referring to my introdcution it is vital to succedd academically due to these hints .
