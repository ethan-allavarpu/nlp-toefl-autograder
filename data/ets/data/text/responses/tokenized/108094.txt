In these days , people should consider a tour guide as a mark that guides lost people .
I prefer to travel in a group that is led by a tour guide because i might find things easier and more comfortable .

While traveling to other country , the main thing that our family think about it is that how we will get to our appartment and who will take us to visit the places in the country .
The tour guide is the one that will take us to our appartment or hotel , and he will gonna explain thing about the city ot the coutry because he is the son of his country .

Going with a tour guide made us learn many things , for example when we visited England we found many statues , parks , trees , trains and rivers .
Each one of theses was explained clearly and accurately about its time and place and when did they found it and how long that it will exist , all that was known by the tour guide .
we learned many things and we had more experience about this country .

Without going with a tour guide we may get lost .
A tour guide is like a north star that guides lost people .
Before few years , when we went to visit Australia we thought that we might not need to use a tour guide and because of that we had alot of problems and troubles .
We were trying to find a park from evening until night and when we reached there everyone was lost .

In the conclusion , a tour guide is better to use because he guides lost pe
