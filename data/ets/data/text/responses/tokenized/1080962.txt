As the economy and travelling ablities growing rapidly , more and more people are addicted in travelling worldwide or natiionwide .
Commonly , there are two ways of enjoying our tour , one is travel by ourselves with a tour guide , the other one is joining a group and to be led by a tour guide .
In my opinion , I wil definitely choose travel alone to taste my tour .

At first place , why is the travelling so facsinating ?
The extoic culture , history , art , architecture , all these are attracing people to step out their own home and get involved in the fantastic amusement of the tour .

How can I touch the soul of the other forms of humanbeing 's culture with only a few days of even only a few minutes ?

history and culture , the tour guide will speak clearly to us .

I can get through the visiting places 's information online , I can communicate with the house owner for renting , also I can bargan with the host , and from my prospensity , these are also the part of enjoyment of the tour .
So , In a word , I can have more fun if i arrange the tourment with my self .

In addition , I like to travel with my lover together , so for this reason i will not choose go with a group beceause of lacking private time and space .

From the arguemnt discussed above , I hold the negative attitude towrds that the best way to travel is on a group led by atour guide , just for the reasons sta
