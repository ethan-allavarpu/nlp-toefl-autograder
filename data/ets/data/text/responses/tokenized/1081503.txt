It is often said that tour guide with many people is the best way to travel because it is cheap and safe .
However I strongly disagree with this opinion .
This is because that feeling satisfaction through the trip and spending time well .

First of all , people have to be satisfied with their trip .
People usaully want to see , hear , eat , and feel what they want and have wanted when they are travelling .
However , in a group tour , people can not experience whatever they want because they have to follow their guide .
For example , when I went to Paris for trip alone I unwillingly took part in a guide tour one time to go to museam .
Because museam entrance fee is cheaper for group .
Unfortunately , I did not have satisfaction with the guide tour for museam , because there were so many people , so I could n't see all of them what I want to see and could n't get much information what I expected .

In addition , traveling individaully is better at spending valuable time .
Time can not return or use again , so it is very important how to use time .
However , in a group tour , it is easy to waste people 's valuable time .
To demostrate , according to the research at Harvard , individual trip spend time two times more effectively than grop tour .
Moreover according to this studying , people who travel individually is also more satisfied with their time consuming and whole traveling .

In brief , the best way to travel is in a individaul , not in a group because making feel good during trip and well time consuming .
