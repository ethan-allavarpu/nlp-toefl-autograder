young or old ..
it 's all about joy

There are differences between the thinking of old and young people due to several reasons , the most important of it is their life style and experience , and their methods to enjoy themseves , as the definitions of enjoying life and how to enjoy life can differ from young people to older people in a huge scale .

as a young woman , i believe that youth enjoy life for the sake of enjoying it and not for the happiness that this joy can result .
Young people think that there are many years left in life and we should enjoy it as much as possible before they have serious responsibilities such as career and family .
unfortunatly , some times enjoying life for young people means irresponsiblity and careless in life , this is not true for all young people , but many of them interprete it this way .

According to what i mentioned before , i dont agree with the statment that says `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' , as i believe that older people do enjoy life , but in a different way than younger generation would understand , this is due in many reasons like the lack of communication between older and younger generations , and their different difinitions of enjoying life .

For example , i enjoy life by traveling around the world and by meeting new freiends and new contacts , and i always request my mother to do so , but she as an older generation tells me that her biggest joy now is to raise her children well , and to watch them get successful and happy , while years ago she used to enjoy her self differently .

Therefore , i believe that older people enjoy life as much as younger people , and sometimes even more , but the difference is about the thinking of older people , and their experiences after growing wise and mature , which are great things that the younger generation can learn from , and therefore enjoy life more .
