The following essay deals with the question , wheater it is useful to have a broad knowledge or a smaller specific knowledge of many academic subjects or not .

Firstly , it is obvious that there is no general answer for this question , because our modern world of work is too diverse for that .
A wide knowledge of academic topics is needed for repsonsible jobs such as politicans or higher managers .
In some situtations they do not have a lot of time to decide what would be right or wrong .
In such cases they have to know things clearly and precisely to avoid a wrong decisions .

Another point is the educational sector of work .
People who work in this category have to know the majority of their subject and very detailed as well .
Proffessors or just a regular teacher have the duty to have a broad knowledge , because they must answer questions immediatly and precise .

Other jobs may not require a huge knowledge on academic subjects , because there are jobs , which need a vast background of knowing all details and all information existened on one specific issue .
People working in labs do not need to know all about chemistry , when they do repatative work such as reproduce specific drugs .

Therefore easy or repatative work does not own the necessity to have wide knowledge .

In conclusion it is necessary to distinguish between the huge differences of our modern jobworld .
As I mentioned before , it is not possible to give an overall answer on this topic and it is useful to examine every case seperately .
