HAVING A BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY ACADEMIC SUBJECTS , OR SPECIALIZING IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT ?
Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make the students know a little of every subject but it wo n't get focused on a specific subject .
Specializing in one specific subject can make the students know everything in one subject but wo n't make them know almost anything about other subjects .

People choose jobs and they only have to know all the information about that specific subject that they work on .
They are n't responsible to know information about any other subject .
These way the distrubition of jobs are formed .

Although this way job distrubitions are formed , knowing everything about one subject can make people boring .
Knowing a little about every subject makes people open minded and more interesting .
They can look at the world at different angles and since humans are social livings , a little color into everyone 's life is needed .

If people only knew about one topic and had no idea about any other topic , everybody would be boring .
People would only make friends with people of the same job type because they would have no common subject with people of other job types .

If the people knew a little of everything and did not focus on one topic , then everybody would have to do all of its work itself and no job distribution would be made .
Also subjects like science , history , geography , surgery , etc . .
would not go alot of distance because nobody would be working on mainly one topic .
This way new inventions and explorements would not be made .

In the conclusion , I think only focusing on one subject and not knowing anything about other topics , also knowing a little of every topic and not focusing on one are both bad but if I had to choose one , I would say that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects because this way the standards of life do not decrease , only people get more boring and have friends only of their own area of knowledge , but by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects make the life standards decrease .
