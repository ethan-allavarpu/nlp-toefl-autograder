i think that learning facts and understanding ideas are both important to know everything you could possibly know about a certain subject .

but when it comes to what is more important i think that understanding concepts and ideas is the reason why there is facts for example if a scintest didnt try new experements and went to knew plases and learnd new concepts he could never come up with a fact that everybody studies and knows .

usually a fact is more respected than a concept because the fact is certain and its there to see or to check but the concept may be a littel frightning because its hard to predect wether it is going to be a fact or the people will simply forget it therefore the people rather to study a fact-full major than a concept major at the university .

all the new cars and the new building start as a concept and the engineers modify it as they want and when they are all done they start doing the project , after the project is introduced it becomes a fact for everyone who doesnt know about the concept in the first place .

denying that the facts are important in our lives is wronge but i think that they are less important than the concepts .
for example the fact is a result of a long-time thinking and studying ready to read and learn in a number of lines , so it is much easier to learn an existing fact than to think about one using concepts and ideas .

finally if a person wants to get the best possible of knowledgment he should consider and study both facts and ideas becaus the start of every fact is to prove the idea and introduce the concept .
