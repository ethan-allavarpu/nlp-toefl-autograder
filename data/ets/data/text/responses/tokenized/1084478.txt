The world is changed , also people are changed .
Young people became more irresponsible , the world became more competitive and young people started not to care about things happening around themselves .

First of all , young people are irresponsible to what they do .
Young people are not helping the communities .
We ca n't say , not at all .
But it is reduced compare to long ago when it was 1900s , when the revolutions were occured .
At that time the leading group was university students .
But these days , those age people are harming and ruin the society .
Since they do n't have any difficulties such as coup de ta't , war , or revolution .
They became addicted to drugs , crimes and other bad stuff .
They are not responsible to what they did , especially for rich people when they make problem , they ask their parents to solve the problem .
These irresposible acts by young people ruin the society more than pasts .

Secondly , the world became more competitive .
Since , the unemployment goes high and competition rasies .
Young people do n't have time to help their own communities , besides community services which they have to do as a school works .
Young people should spend their time more in the studying to get a job or to make their business bigger .
Otherwise they will be buried from the society .
For example , my country during the 1970s people who graduated universities could choose company where they want to work .
But these days , even from the first rank universities ca n't get a job .
The percentage they get a job was 77 percent .
It means it will become harder and harder .
Also , the competition will be more and more .

Lastly , young people do not care about things happening around them .
Young people became selfish because of the second reason .
So that they became dull about other people 's harshness and hardships .
So when they see old people standing in the bus when they are sitting down .
They rather ignore them or pretend sleeping .
Young people do n't want to involve other people 's business , especially dangerous thing .
When I was watching news program , I saw an interesting news that shows the survey .
The surveyer asked people that when they see perverts in a crowded subway .
Most of people answered they will ignore it .
They think that that 's not their business .

As time goes by , the world became harder to live .
And lesser people are helping the difficulties in societies , even though the society becomes harder , I want to encourage young people to help their society .
When they ask me why , I will answer that `` you will see the different . ''
