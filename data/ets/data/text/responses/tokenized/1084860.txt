The statement contents that in twenty years the number of cars in use will decline .
I do not agree with the claim .
According to me , the number of cars will continue to increase thouh there might be a change in the technology which they use .

As the population continues to grow , so are the needs .
And , car is emerging as a basic need of the world today .
Technological advances have made the dream of a common man , to own a personal car , true .
The rates of the car have never been so low , and this sharp decline of prices will continue as the technology progresses .
This would further encourage their sale in the near future , as more and more people will be able to afford one .

In earlier times , cars were meant only for the main member of the family , the earning heads .
While today , even children and other family members use cars for their personal needs .

Moreover , nowadays , the two-seater sedans are in vogue .
This means that if a family of four members use a single car today , they may go on to use two 2-seaters in future .

Futhermore , the other modes of conveyance like the buses or the three wheelers generally cause more pollution than that generated by the cars .
Nowadays , cars have been manufactured which use electricity or solar energy to run .
The availibility of such cars at affordable prices will help , to some extent , check the , so called , never-ending pollution problem , and hence will be supported by the government of any nation .

However , the increase in the number of cars will accelerate the problem of traffic .

Thus , I strongly feel that in future , the number of cars being used will continue to rise and so will the problem of traffic , but with a decline in the pollution .
