In my opinion enjoyment have avery different meanings .
it varies from one perspective to other .
some people think that singing dancing or other entertainment is enjoyment .
and others think that reading books , helping others watching the nature is their kind of enjoyment .
so if we think about age group mostly younger people wants to enjoy life more than the older people .
whatever ma be the type of enjoyment younger people wants to do it copletely without hesitations , restrictions .

Young age is the only stage in the life where everyone full of colous , ambitious .
the peoples feelings are just like beautiful butterflies .
eventhough now a days the younger generaation baame so competitive , careeroriented , they just dont want to suppress their joys .
they are sharing their happiness , sadness .
they are going to discos , concerts , cinemas .
here exactly the older genaration is opoosing the younger ones .

Old people are usally more mature and behaves like a stioic to the sitations .
they take whaeever comes in their life in the same way because their experiences taught them a lot in their life .

one imortant reason for this variations in enjoyment is differances in the hormanal leval .
as the person becomes old his hormonal influences become less evident .
their enjoyment levels and expressions directly corresponds with it .

Even though some exceptions for this are ther but on the whole , younger people enjoyment is higher than the older people .
in my house also i want to celebrete all the festivals in a grand way .
but my parents are always restricting me to that .
though at that moment i feel bt later in my life who knows that i might do the same thing !

So in my opinion in general youngsters enjoy more than the old age groups .
the reasons might be hormonal influences or attitude towards life or theeir experiences or they know the value of the monet better .
