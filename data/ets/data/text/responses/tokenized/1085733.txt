I totally agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
I have three reasons to explain this .

First , the aim of the advertisment is to sale more products .
No producer wants to decrease the functions of the products in the adversitiment .
On the contray , the producer will try their best to show the positive aspects of the products and minimize the negative aspects .
So , the products in the advertisement will only have the advantages .
For example , the advertisement of the medicine will only tell the customs which disease it can curve and neglect the serious point of the medicine .
Some customs will be extra-damaged by the medicine for the negative aspects of the medicine .

Second , in order to sale more products , the producers enlarge the functions of the products in the advertisements .
The products in the advertisement will be much better .
For example , the mineralized water are good to the health of human body .
Some producer take the mineralized water as penecean which can be used as medicine to some illness .

Third , the advertisement is a goods too .
The advertiser can sale it only when it can satisfied the producer of the products .
That means the advertiser need to make sure the product in the advertisement should be excellent , even better than it actually it .

From the above , we can draw a conclusion that the products in most advertisements are not the same as themselves .
Their funcitions are been enlarge in the advertisement .
So , the goverment should care about this problem to let the custom know the truth of the products .
