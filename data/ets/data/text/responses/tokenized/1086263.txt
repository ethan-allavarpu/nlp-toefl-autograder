I do agree that most advertismenets make products seem much better than they really are .

A possible explaination would be that these advertisements are based on different surveys made by professionals in order to know what the target public want to hear .
For example , if a company wanted to sell a new skate board , it will interview teenagers who are skateboarding to know what they are looking for in a perfect product .
They will do the same with the parents of the skateboarders because ther are the one who will pay for it .
Once these informations are analyzed , a publicity will be made out of that .
The content of this advertisement would be based on scientifcal data .
The target public will see in the products exactly what they are looking for , it will appear as the perfect product .
However , they might be disapointed once they have bought the item realizing that it is not that perfect .

An other way to illustrate my point is the advertisement for Kraft 's dinner products .
This publicity targets whoever makes lunches at home , i.e. the mother and their kids .
The product is sold as a healthy and convenient lunch .
The kids look really happy to eat it and it seems really tastefull .
However , one can easilly realize that Kraft 's dinner products are not a healthy meals and are not tastefull .

The publicity conceptors know that someone will be more likely to buy a product if it as a pretty presentation .
That is the reason why all the products are in nice little boxes with bright colors and printed with impressive designs .
An other way to make a product look attractive is by using the picture of a good looking women or a handsome men .
Therefore , the client will purchase the item in order to be closer to the model on the box .
But the product inside might not be that exceptionnal .

In conclusion , I think that advertisements company are able to identify the desires of customers and make a nice publicity featuring all them .
They are able to show a way to people to reach their dreams .
But dreams does not always come true . ..
