BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY SUBJECT IN COMPARISION TO ONE SPECIALIZATION ON ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT .

There is a famous saying that `` knowledge once gained is gained forever '' .
Academics play a important role in one life it prepares a base for a person to reach a highest point of attainment of knowledge , but as with just a mere knowledge about anything we cant get the successs so therefore specialization is needed .
Today world is greatly moving forward going for new advances in every aspect of life either it may be in terms of health , engineering , agriculture , pharmacy , commerece , management etc or any field .

Every day advances are coming in every field , this change in society can be through change in field of research and technology .
The scientist , engineers who are experimenting new techniques is through specialization in one single stream .
if a persons do not get specialised in `` it would be like jack of all and masters of none '' , but this it is also important that a person can lead to final assesment through collecting all the evidences for every single conclusion a approach to other field is also desirable so basic knowledge of other subject is very necessary to reach the result .

Knowledge is a process of continous learning , it requires lot os skill to learn knowlegde same as during schooling it is necessary to study all subjects as it interact us with worldly important things and later on when we move to subjects of our choice we move to particular stream we gain knowledge about every basic aspect about it later on we reach to specialised subject .

The concept is same as child when he comes to this world he needs to take small steps first to learn to run in future .
So at the end i would i like to say thatbroad knowledge of many academic subject is essential but to reach a hard core research or invention specialisation is compulsory .
