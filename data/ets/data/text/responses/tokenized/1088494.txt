Advertising has always been a interesting discussion topic for the people .
some people think that advertising is not very effective and does not do any wonders .
on the other hand , there are also some people who think that advertising really has alot to do .
and I think , I would be counted in the second group .

Advertising may make anything better by the a good picturization of that product .
the better the picturization , the better would be fascination towards the product .
and looks matters alot .
for example , we go to some coffee shop and there we see alot of coffees and all the coffees are totally unknown to you .
which one would you like to have ?
certainly , that looks most appealing to you .
is n't it ?
that is where advertising comes into the picture .
Its magic of advertising .

Advertising enables us to show the good sides of anything .
as we all know , that anything in this world is not perfect .
all the things have dark sides too .
so with a little help of advertisment , we can highlight the positive points of some product and can hide the negative parts .

for an instance , lets take example of cold drinks like , cola , pepsi etc. these drinks are so popular among the people .
but the question is why are they ?
while we know that these drinks are not good for health .
even then they do a great deal of bussiness all over the world .
Credit of this should go to the advertising .
advertising totally hid the negative effects of the drinks and made them popular .

Nowadays , even some schools are providing training for how to do the advertising .
these schools considers advertising as an art .
and we all know that what art is for .
yeah , to increase the beauty of something .
and thats what an advertisement does .
advertisement increases the worth of the product .

A coin has two faces .
now , it is upto us how we are going to show it to the others .
Advertising not only tells us how should we present something , but also how to present it with even a better looks .
In conclusion , advertisement enhances the worth and beauty of the products .
and that make people buy them .
