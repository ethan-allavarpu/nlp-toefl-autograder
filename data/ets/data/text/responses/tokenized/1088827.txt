I agree , it is the best way to travell in a groups led by a tour guide because in groups the tour may be fulfilled with full of fun and joy .

One can always feel boring to travell as accompained .
the tour in groups all together can fell like one family as brothers , sisters , uncles grandfathers and grandmothers .
So there we feel very happy by spending with all the group people and there is no worries as there is a guide who helps and shows all the locations all the way .

In groups there is no need of a security problem no feeling of lonelyness .
In groups we may have many concessions in the fairs and some packages which were offered at low rates this was an advantage for travelling in groups .

The best example when i 'm in high school we had a tour to NewDelhi in meanwhile we enjoyed all the way in the train by singing songs , dancing and commenting one another .
After reaching there we in group visited all the tourist spots and spent very jolly .

It was the time when I visited the same locations alone and i felt very bad , even not intrested to see all the places .
Another reason is the people with whom do we like to have the tour may is always busy or unable to have time to come with us .
So we never feel missing them when we move in groups .
We dont know the time spent with them it is like a magic me may forget all the things and move to the new world of dreams .

Everyone likes to visit all the places , bu mostly they think about the travelling time and the expences .
If we travell in single the expences will be more we should spent moreon the comodities for our needs .
In the groups travellin expences for person to person may vary as the number of persons is incresaing cost for head to head may vary .
So within the low budget , with security , with company we may have our tour sucessfully with lot of joy and happiness .
