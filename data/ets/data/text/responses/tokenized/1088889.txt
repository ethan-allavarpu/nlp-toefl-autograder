Many people prefer to take a trip alone without tour guide .
They say that they do like it because they want to avoid people , planned moving and take a break with self-time .
Although it is suitable reaons , traveling in a group with a tour guide has many advantages that deserves we should do it .
Not only group touring can reduce danger in abborad nations , but also it is really convinient and make us visit essential points .

First of all , group touring with tour guide includes less danger of tripping foreign countries than tripping alone .
Since people are not familiar with foreign nations , there are much danger of frauding or any accidents .
For example , many Koreans are frauded by foriegners during East Asia trip .
It includes muders , robbing and so on .
Moreover if there are accidents in foreign countries , people usually embrassed so they can not do properly .
However , since guides are usually people of that country , they well know about country 's conditions and situations so dangers decrease much .

Next , group touing is really comfortable and help us to see essential places .
Since tour companies already make plans and reservate completely , people can enjoy journey with only following schedules .
For instance , It is needless to say that there are no danger to lack of hotel rooms because companies already booked them .
Moreover , as stated above , guides knows well about that country , so he can bring us to most famous and beautiful places .

As I mentioned above , group tour led by a tour guide has many advantages .
It contains less dangers because we doing group and led by tour guide .
Also , it is convinient since companies already make a schedule about trip , only we should do it is following plans .
Therefore I agree with that the statement , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
