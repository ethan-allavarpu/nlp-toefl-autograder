There is one or two thing make a country more powerfull and more beatiful .
On of them is young people in the country .
If they can work for their communities good they can make their country very beautiful too .
However i think its so hard to set young people for this type actions .
Because they grow up so stupidly and so lazy .
They have been train from their parents to act like these .

At this time young people start to think their self more than otherthing when they are a little child .
They force their family to do their wants with crying and other things to whichs are family dont see in their child .
They act like this beause families dont give them to thinkings to understand what happened in the world and what should them do to survive in this wolrd .
They grow up and enter a world which they dont know to live with .
They are not ready to see real world how can they live in this world .
They did more thing when they are growing but they dont give time to understand their communities .
So how can they help to their communities even if they dont know their communities requirements .
Howevet i think this is not young adults faults .
This is their parents fault , this is fault of who manage their country or their world .

Because of all of these young people do not give time to helping their communities .
Yes i accept this 's not all of their faults .
They can easily trained to be good child , good citizen and so good people .
We can solve this problem with some formules if we are really want to solve this .
We can give our teens responsibility to their communities .
We can give them good opportunities to think more and help their communities .
