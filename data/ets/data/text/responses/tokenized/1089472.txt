I agreed with the statement , because when the student understand the ideas and concepts with clear examples in class more information the student retaint in time , and then the student can use this ideas and concepts in the near future and in the far future .
I thinks this because I use this principle all time during my studing life , and in my profesional life , in fact many time I use information adquired in my first years of university in special topics of biology and chemestry , matters that I not use normally in my work .
Another point is when a student understand ideas and concepts , the studet can use this ideas and concept in relation with others , to understad new know , or made theory about unknow topics , and this is very important in the creation of new concept or the developmewnt of the science and ingeniery .
Is more , is the base of the evolution of the society , when more ideas or concept understand the studen best development have in the studies and in the futre work .

For another hand , if the student learn facts is more difficult to the student made relationship between different facts , because is possibilite they don-t have a clear relation , and normally to find a relationship between fact is necesarie ideas and concetp to help to find the relation .
