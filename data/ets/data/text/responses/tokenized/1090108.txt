No wonder young people enjoy life more than older people .
In my opinion , in the early ages people can do lots of things easily without worring anything .
They just decide and enjoy what they do .
I agree that young people have more chance to enjoy life for the following reasons : having less dependencies than older people , and the desire of learning new information and having experience .

First , young people have less dependencies such as looking after someone , the need of earning money or health issues - obstacles for travelling countries - than older people have .
Young people are able to travel different countries easily without thinking anybody stays back like children .
For example , my parents have three children including me .
If they want to travel to Spain during the rest of their time , they can not leave their children because children need to be looked after .
In this case , young people who do not have any children can easily go for travelling .

Moreover , young people usually want to learn and gain a lot of different kinds of experience during their early ages .
I can remember , when my brother was nineteen he used to go to music festivals , theathers , and travel a lot .
Basically , he enjoyed a lot because he had time , sufficent amount of money and energy .
Also , he could easily adapt difficult conditions whatever he faced with .
I can not imagine that older people join a party and a boat trip at the same day .

In conclusion , older people and young people can not be compared ehether young people enjoy the life more than older people or not .
So basically , young people should be aware of their opportunities in order to enjoy the time .
