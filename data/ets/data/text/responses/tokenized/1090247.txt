The one of my favorite hobby is traveling .
I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I think , when I travel without any tour guide , I can go any place which I would like to go , and I can find my favorite places or things , and I can get more strong friendships .

Fistly , without any tour guide , our travel will be more flexible for planning where to go or when to go .
In my case , when I traveled with a tour guide , there was the place where I wanted to stay for more longer time , but he said `` we must go to next . ''
I felt unsatisfied .

Secondly , it is possible for me to find a place or a thing which is not so famous .
That is to say , I will get my own special place or thing .
I do not like crowded place , so if I can find unfamous , but very good place or thing for me , I think I am happy .

Finally , if there is no guide for our group , we will get togehter to make our travel more precious .
I have a friend good at making a schedule , so with her I feel more happy , and our travel will become more valuable , moreover , our friendship will become more strong .

For these reasons , I think the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide is not so good .
Traveling is very exciting , so I wish I could go everywhere .
