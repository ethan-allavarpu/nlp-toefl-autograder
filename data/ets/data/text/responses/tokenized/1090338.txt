Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This statement is very true as a person who tries to do things differently and takes a different approach towards certain things in life proves to be successful , but the success can not be guaranteed .
If a person goes about doing things as he usually does and is perfect at , he will not suffer any loss but will be stable , no growth and no loss , these are the people who like to play it safe in life and lead a life without stress ans tension where as taking risks in life is a stressful thing but you can increase your growth only by trying new things and innovating ideas and ways of doing things .
A careful analysis is very important about the type of risk bieng taken and what is the appropriate method for going about the decision .
Most business houses have been successful because of their ability to take risks and try innovative strategies and plans .
Such people like to enjoy life to the fullest and are determined about what they want in life and work their way upto it .

I believe that people should take risks in life but they also should be careful and know the pros and cons of taking the risk .
They should take risk that they can bear .
Without taking risks a person acnnot achieve what he wants , he will have to be satisfied with what he has .
Only people who have the thirst in them to achieve what they want take risks , some succeed and some fail .
Therefore it has to be well strategised and well planned inorder to reach the objective and move ahead in life .
Risk has extreme consequences , you either suceed or you fail , so people should take risk knowing what they are getting into .
Therefore its not everyone'scup of tea to take risks and those who do not have the heart to bear the loss should not go ahead with it .
