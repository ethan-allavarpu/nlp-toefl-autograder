As you know , some people are so busy because their lives especially young people .
There are a lot of things to do in their lives .
Sometimes they work long time and they ca n't take their time .
Some of them work hardly depends on their jobs .
These days , people work hard because time is very important for them .
They want to use exact time in their jobs .
During this period they can forget to help their communities .
I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

First of all , young people has a lot of things to do .
Business is very important in their lives .
They want to get perfect life and to be a good family person .
They work in a hard or an easy job and time is limited for them .
Their community is a second thing because of their own job lives .

Secondly , young people want to give time for own their time .
They do something to relax .
For instance , they go to somewhere during their free time .
they have some kinds of hobbies and some young people want to be alone .
They can help themsleves .
There is no time for their communities .

Finally , young people 's rythm is vey different or changeable .
This situation depends on their own personal properties .
some of them are very workholic , some of them are very lasy .
Furthermore , environmental changes effect them .
They can change easily about thier behaviour .
Indeed , something is not important for them .
They have not a good relationship between they and their family or friends .
Most of works or jobs can effect them easily .
They can forget what they have one family or friends .

In briefly , time can found hard because of some specific reasons to give enough time to helping someone .
Indeed , giving a time to help someone depends on our hand .
These days , everybody want to get a good life or a job .
