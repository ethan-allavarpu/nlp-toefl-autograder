Korean parents , who has traditionally shown huge intersts on childern 's education , seem to be competing to send their chidren to most munber of private academies .
I should admit that childern should accumulate a lot of knowlege to understand the world , or the lead a successful life in the futer .
However , I believe that more emphasis should be put on understanding the ideas and concepts .

First of all , compulsion of acquiring lots of knowledge will make the student lose the interests on the subject they 're studying .
When a student is force to go to several privite academies by his mom 's wish like one of my students , she wo n't have chance to consider what I want to know the most .
As a matter of a fact , the student spents lots of time studying English , math and science but all she wishes about the academies is to quit them .

Moreover , just gaining more knowlede beyond the student 's understanding is not efficient at all .
For example , another student of the academy where I teach , should take 3 coursed every day .
Of course , it is not by his will but by his mom 's wish .
In spite of the amount of time he spends at the academy , he fails to show decent understanding for any of the classes .
Because he takes too much , he is having a hard time understanding the lessons .

Undoubtedly , having a lot of knowledge is very useful and important .
However , I believe the study process should follow the steps neede to be efficient .
Students should have chance to learn about what it is like .
For that they should understand the field .
