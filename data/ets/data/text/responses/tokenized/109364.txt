When I read about successful people 's wrting about their lives , their success is always based on their very special new methods or inventions .
Moreover , nowadays new challange is develop brand new ideas .
Every human being always seek new ideas and new products to make them successful .
Present world already has been developed too much for regular ideas or inventions .
Moreover , people who succeeded always had hard times with them .
In my opinion , because they faced with their problem and they overcome it , they can called successful people .

First of all , the successful people 's common stereotype is not satisfy to the present situation and always challange to the new one .
Walt Disney did not satisfied with his current society 's broadcast .
He invented variety Disney characters such as `` Mikky Mouse '' or `` Minni Mouse '' .
This new characters contributed to obtain children 's attention , and it becomed the fuel for Walt Disney 's success .
In addition he nevered stoped to create new characters , his unstoppable tring also make his success more shiny .

Second of all , the people who reach their success took lots of rick than ordinary people .
It is not true that person can make their forturn in one try except the lottary .
Successful people always took higher risk to obtain more new and valuable result from their try .
When the Bill Gates was young man , he was attended to Harberd University and he was respected by others to just attend in the Harberd .
However , when he tried to make the Microsoft programs , there are some episodes about he failed at his classes in university .
Bill Gates gave up his reputations of Harverd .
Normal people usually not doing it .

Third of all , Successful people did not stop to develope themselves .
They always try new things with risk but never give up about it .
They try and try untill they get satisfied data or result about it .
Then they start to new try based on their collected informations .
Piccaso is the famouse artist of the modern ages and his one painting values like more than million dollars .
His work at that time was not that noticable because his painting was too creative .
However , he did not give up drawing .
He just kept draw and draw by his way .
After he died , until now , we thought his painting is very creative and we gave him a creadit for it .

In short , Successful people try new things although they could take serious risks , and they never give up untill they reach their goal .
Therefore , I strongly agree with the statement that is given .
