I completely agree with the topic that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than they are today .
Today the technology is more advanced than yesteryears and there can be more advancement in the near future .
With the advancement of technology cars may be replaced by some newer inventions .

Firstly , if we consider the time before fifty or sixty years back , there were more number of bicycles .
And after that , with the invention of bikes people mostly travelled on them .
Further with the invention of cars the number of bikes and their usage has decreased .

After twenty years there may be any other advanced invention which may replace the cars .
For instance if a flying machine is invented for benefit of a common man then there will be more flying machines and less number of cars .

Secondly it can be said that the needs of the people keep changing with time .
After twenty years if some thing more cheaper or more advanced than cars is made available then there can be fewer cars than they are today .
With the increase in needs of people any other advanced invention can replace cars .
And the number of cars can decrease .

Lastly i conclude that in the next twenty years there will be less number of cars than they are today .
