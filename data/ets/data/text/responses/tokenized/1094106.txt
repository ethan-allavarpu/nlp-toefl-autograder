People have to study lots of things in their life .
Some of them want to interest many things and others prefer specific things .
Although having lots of information releated to anything , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

If you want to have broad knowledge , you have to work hard on everything .
This way is very difficult for people .
In addition , you can not achive something properly if you chose broad knowledge .
Furthermore you can not know everything about your subjects , because you have to study for every subjects .

On the other hand , specialize in one specific subject is not difficult as another because , they have to work on only one topic .
This event provide some adventages for you .
For example ; because you work on only one topic , you can do your researches broadly and you know everything about this subject .

As a result , to specialize in one specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academi subjects .
I think people use this way to be successful .
