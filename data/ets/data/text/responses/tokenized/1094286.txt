I don ' t think young people enjoy life more than old people .
I tnink that they prefer to live their life in different ways .
Infact youn people love leisure time , love play togheter , they have to know the word and make new experience .
For example the summer holidays are the weeks of the year more attended in which they don ' t have to think to school and where the only think that they can do is to play every day or to go to the sea .

In my case , I am 22 years old , I enjoy life not only because i can stay with my friend an go to dance or to the pubs , I also love life because I have a lot of opportunities , I need to know more thinks that i can , i need to realise myselves .
I want a good work and a good career , I want to marry and a family .

Old people enjoy life not less than young people , but i think that they have already left this important moment of their life and they prefer to stay togheter in quite and not busy place .

An example is my grandmother .
She is 78 years old .
She likes to stay home to watch tv or to read lots of books .
She likes to cook and to fill her leisure time with her friend to speak .
On holiday she like to stay every day on the sun , she prefer to go out for a walking to look the landscapes or to eat the ice cream .

I think that youngh people and old people enjoy life , but they have different interests and different way experience of the life .
If young people need to realise themselves , old people need to live the rest of their life to know more that they know .
I can define them the experts of life .
