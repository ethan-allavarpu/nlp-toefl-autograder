the statement says the young people enjoy more than older people .
personally , i do n't agree this statment in all of this part .
infact , by my points of view the young people is less responsable of other mature people .
generally , in the last years the way to enjoy life is changed .
infact today young peole have less problem than young people of forty years ago for example .
today a boy depends totally from his parents .
in this way he have less responsability and this caused a total insoddisfaction of all .

instead of the young people , the older people have achieved a total maturity that permitt they to enjoy life more than young people with small things , like a only dinner with friends or a travel with family .

it is also true that the young boys have a lot of enthusiam respect to older people .
but this concept do n't go to over see the problem .
there are also cases where older people do n't enjoy life beacuse they have very big problem like the fact of to not fand a work or for example because their are very tyred .

so , my personal opinion is that the young boy , in the state of parity of conditions , do n't enjoy life so much .
infact also in my family i see that my parents enjoy life more than me and my brother .
finally , in this way i say that i disagree with the above statement .
