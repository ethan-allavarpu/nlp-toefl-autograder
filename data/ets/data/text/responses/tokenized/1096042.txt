Successful people tend to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
why I used `` tend '' above is that that is a possiblility , not an absolute solution for the successful people , otherwise the answer should depends on how to define `` successful people '' and how do successful people success ?
If success means money , and someone who are called successful people comparatively , but not a real money bag like BIll Gates , there is no absolute answer for success .
However , even in that case , the possibility for the success is consistently changing up to definition of success or how much are they successful .

Apparently , the possibility for success are given to the people who are willing to try something new .
Because in the fields that have been well-known benefit makers .
many people have already taken their benefits from that , not much things other people can gain and it could be called as monopoly .
It 's like fossil fuel depletion .
Small part of the world are still taking big gain from the fossil fuel , there is no chance to get entered in that industry , because that fileds are already full with prior property .
In a given situation like their DNA , such as their looking or how they are smart , like how much money do they get from their parents , the possi ble way to improve their possibility for success is to challenge to uncovered world .
Even though they are having the risky business which is originated from itself ( becuase it 's new ! )
the people who only doing what they already know how to do well can not easily catch up with those people who try to do something new and their great-great success rather than great or just success .

I am aiming great-great success like I wrote above , what i require to get the goal is to improve my credativity , to be enough creative to find something new and explore it .
There is a word in my country `` If the water is stuck in one place , those will be decayed . ''
