Schools that teach k-12 students require students to study various subjects .
These subjects that the students learn are not necessarly useful in their carrier .
I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

If it is better to master in one specific subject , why do the schools teach numerous subjects to the students ?
A student might agree that the subjects that they are learning in school is useless and meaningless to learn .
This is not true because as you grow more mature you will realize that the thing you learned in school really comes to help in the real life .
So it is better to study and have knowledge on various types of subjects rather than having unlimited knowledge on one subject .

It may seem better to specialize in one specific subject when you get a specific job that require those knowledges you learned .
Well , this is just in your carrier .
When you get out to the social world , the things you learned are too professional that no one , but you and people who work with it understand .
If you want to get involved in a social life and understand life better , it is better to know many things .
For an example , when you go to a party where all kinds of different people gather .
You want to talk to people , but you only know that specific topic and do not know other topics that people talk about .
As a result , you will be secluded and feel alone .

In conclusion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
With broad , but many knowledge you will enjoy better life where you are not left behind , and you will be able to appreciate other people 's opinion more .
On the other hand if you only know about a specific subject , you will be left alone and feel secluded .
To lead a successful life , it is better to know alot of thing rather than a specific topic .
