I agree with this idea .

There is four reasons .

At first , it is more appropriate to play sports because some of the hard sports such kind of succer , basketball and baseball , it is difficult to play for older people .
In fact , there are only young star player in professional league of above sports .
In addition , It is not only the number of sports they can do but also the risk of injuly when they play the sports .
The possility to get injuly is higher in older people case .

Secondly , young people can travel easilly than older people especially foreign country case .
When we trip to somewhere , we sometimes face culture difference with other peoples who live in that place and should have flexible mind to accept such kind of culture difference to have good relationship with them .
Moreover , sometimes it is necessary to communicate with them by their own language .
In that case , we have to learn another language to communicate .
It is easier for young people to learn because of the flexible and fresh thinking way .

Thirdly , young people have enough time to do what they would like to realize .
Basically older people have more social responsibility especially they have sons or daughters .
It is quite difficult to make timing to do in quite tight situation of older people .

Forthly , there are a lot of chances for young people to change situation according to their preferance .
For example , it is easy to get new job for young people rather than older people because they have a lot of potential to learn more about new job .
Main reason is they can work more time due to law .
Currently it is difficult to have jobs for over 60 .
Some of the people who would like to work can not get jobs because of there reasons .
In young people case , it fully depends on themselves .
