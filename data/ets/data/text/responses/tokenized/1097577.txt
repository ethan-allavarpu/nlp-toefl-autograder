Generalization versur Specializations .

Some people prefer specific academic subjects than many academic subjects .
I agree with thhis prefences for several reason .
The fist reason is you can be an expert in the matter .
The second reason is you can get proffesional develop and get a good job , and the third reason is solve specific problems .

The first reason that refers to be a expert in the matter explain the idea to be some person to have the knowledge to get the information and this person can explain and show results .
For instance , the people that studie Bachelor degree in Economics , Master degree in Macroeconomics and Phd in Microeconomics coul be get the profile of kind of person to develop some theory about the behavior in the consume and demand respect the National Economy .

The second reason refers to the posibility to get profesional develop and access to a betters a jobs .
For example , if you have a Phd in Computer Science you can be a candidate for the bigs companies like Microsoft to contract to you .

The Third reason refers to the idea to solve specific problems .
For instance , if you are studying some related with medice maybe you can find the solution to big problems like VIH or Cancer or Diabetis .

In conclusion , I agree with the idea to be specialist in some area is better than get just general knowledges and to be an specialist is equal to say an expert in the matter and maybe be an expert in the matter brings to you in the future profesional develop and oportinities to access betters jobs .
