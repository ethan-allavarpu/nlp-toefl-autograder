Last week I read an article in our daily newspaper about who enjoys life more , female or male .
I considered about these piece of paper a very long time and came to the conclusion that it is more worth to distinguish between young and old people , than between female and male .
But neverthelesse I am of mixed opionion concerning this question .

One the one hand , you might get the expression that young people enjoy life more than older ones if you observe from outside .
But the onliest reason for that is , that young people live their life more active than older ones .
They try new things , have fun whenever there is the chance to have and make their own experiences in order to develope a personality .
Students for instance like to go to partys or hang around at the beach playing soccer because they know , that in later professional life they will not have the chance to act like that .

On the other hand older people have gathered a vast amount of experience during their life .
Consequently they do no longer feel any pressure to act like younger ones .
I believe that they also did have an active , excited life in their youth .
But with a certain decrease in age , other things like family , health or financial sercurity become more and more important for them .
So in my state of view , they simple have a distict way of enjoying their lifes .
They get their satisfaction by going for a healthy walk in the park or having a cup of tea with their husband or wife in the nice restaurant next to the beach .
Unfortunatelly these facts are invisble to people you observe from outside , so the wrong impression might come up that older people do not enjoy their life .

All things recommended , I would state that neither the young nor the older people enjoy their life more .
Both group has its own way to enjoy their life .
The youth often expresses more active while older people are satisfied by a calm and especially healthy life .
