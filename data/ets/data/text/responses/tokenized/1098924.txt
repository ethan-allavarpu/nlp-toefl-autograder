I do not agree with this statement .
In my opinion it is not possible to do such a statement and to make clear what I mean , I 'm going to explain my point of view with some examples .

Befor I started studying medicin I worked as a Rettungsassistentin .
I met a few pepole , old and young ones and I often had the time to talk with them for a while .
Everyone had his own live-story and many of them really liked to tell me about their positions to live and their experience .
Now I would like to describe two really sicnificant conversations I had .

The first conversation I had was with an older woman .
She was about 80 years old and lived in a pension for olds .
She was very sick but always with a smile on her month .
We met a several times and we always talk a lot .
She told me great stories about her and her husband Karl who died 2 years ago .
All the time she felt absolutely fine with herself and the world around and that ' s why I asked her one day what her miracle is like .
She laught and answered me > Young lady , do not belief that I do not know how crule life can be , I have seen it .
But this is the reason why I am so lucky .
I thank good for what I have and I enjoy everyday in my life .
It is a question of position .
> The other situation I would like to describe was with a girl in my age .
She wanted to kill herself becaus her boyfriend left her two days ago and she thougt life would be over know .
For her there were no more sense in life .

I think this statement made at the beginning is not right .
It is important to look individually at everyone !
It is a question of view !
