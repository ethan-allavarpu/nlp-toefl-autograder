the tour guide is very meaningful word for me. becuse i am a student from the institute of tourism .
I should say that a tour guide in a group to travel is the best way .

For the starter , the tour guide must be the person who live in the local place that traveling destination .
So the tour guide should understand the fellow types of the habits in there .
Of course , the beautiful sights and people .
For example , my hometown is Sahnghai , there is a deeply history and revolutionary meaning city before the last century .
I will take a group of travellers to some significant places , like the `` Chenghuang '' temple , and the `` Wai Tan '' bay and so on .
I can provide the varieties of their life , from food to communication .
By the way , I remember a story of my country , a group of traveller from a foreigner country , came the Hunan --- a province of our country .
they had stay there for three days , but they have nothing to guide their travel .
The heavy rain was caused a flood .
After that , they had a sick , they had no medical to care them .
Fortunately , a tour guide from the local helped them from danger , because she could commnication with them and found some pills that made from a special plant .
So that is why the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
even it could save the life .

Finally , I will talk a word tour guide in acient China ---- Xu Xiakeng .
He ever told some words `` Do n't change your tour propose , but a guide will help. '' the word claims that a tour guide is so much important to a group , because everyone who want to travel have a same dream
