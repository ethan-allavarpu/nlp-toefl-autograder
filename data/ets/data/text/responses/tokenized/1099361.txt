I agree with that statement , though i have to admit there are exceptions .
Nowadays , it seems to be all about themselves but nothing else for young people .
They do not mind about the ones in need because they are not even aware of such a thing called `` in need '' exists .
Their family spoil them to no ends which leds the yoiuth to be unaware of whats going on in their community , let alone the world .

The thing with the young people these days is that they are being brain washed by some industries and they are being victims of these industries .
Like the food industry .
They created a new form of ideal for women body and nearly all the young girls are concerned about their weight more than anything else , This nonsence is what is taking their mind of other things .
Like helping their community !!!

And this generation [ which i am a part of ] is very self centered because what is expected from them is perfection .
Which , we all know is impossible to reach .
So to reach that impossible goal of themselves , they give their full attention to theirselves .

I know the things i wrote down is a little bit off the topic , but thinking twice , they are somehow related .
Youth is striving for an unrealistic goal , making them imperfect by the way of characteristics , just the oppose of what they are striving for .
All in all i do agree that my generation is not giving enough time and care to help the others /
