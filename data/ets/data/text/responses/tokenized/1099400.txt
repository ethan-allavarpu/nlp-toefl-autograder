I disagree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than facts for students .
Actually from my point of view , facts are the same important just as ideas and concepts .

First , without facts , how come the ideas and concepts ?
Ideas and concepts can not be separated from facts .
For example , when we learn the concept of force in physics , students need to do experiments to be aware of the fact that there are different kinds of force everywhere in the world .
The teacher will confuse the students if he or she just draw a simbol and point it to them , then say `` Look , it is what we call force '' .
By doing this , the teacher is at the rick of being fired .

Second , students should not just get the ideas and the concepts but also know the detail facts in order to pass the exams .
For example , in a exam of a biological course , students should remember the exact examples of animals in order to describe the progress of reproduction .
I can not image a person can write down all the materials the teacher want without any facts .
Although there may some exams which allowed students to take books with them , remembering the exact facts benifits the students pretty much , because ttey can save the time spent on referring to the books .

Third , students should learn facts in order to find a good job in some cases .
For example , I major in computer science and it involves a lot of programming .
The mathematical concepts and ideas do help me learn theories of computer .
However , It is the time when I tried to find a job that I realized that facts such as the parameters of the computers do me a big favor to find a job as a programmer .

In conclution , while ideas and concepts are important in learning , facts are of the same weight to students .
