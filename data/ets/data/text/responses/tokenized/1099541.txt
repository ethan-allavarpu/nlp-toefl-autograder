I think the statement is to absolute .
I remeber when i was young , there where not that much possibilities to help the community and they where also not attractive to young people .
There is also a big difference where you live .
In large city there are not that many communities you can evolve like they are in smaller villages or smaller towns .

Another point is the fact that nowadays young people have a lot more to do and not that much time like it was years ago .
They have to go to school or learn a lot and most young people have to work besides their school to earn money to life .
If they already have a job besides school they propably will not take a community job without getting paid .
They do not have the time and the money to help the community .

Working in the community has also advantages wich most young people do not know about .
A community job integrates you in your environment if you are new .
It can also help you to find friends , or the community helps you if you got a problem .
It also can give you social hold if you do not know what to do or have no other things in you live .
It is a good way for older people who do not have to work anymore to get a job for their live .
And to get integrated in their social envionment .

But in my oppinon it is true , young people do not give enough time to their communities .
Even if it is not the same that it was years ago .
The most important point is the social contact they get in their community .
