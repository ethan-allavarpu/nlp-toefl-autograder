I agree with the statement , mainly because I think that it is imperative for students to understand ideas and concepts and knowing how to act upon them is more important than just knowing facts .

From my experience in highschool , I think students in general find it much easier to just learn facts rather than understanding concepts and ideas .
One simple example is when I used to love `` labelling the heart diagram '' in biology class but just despise explaning Newton 's First principle law of motion in physics class .
On the contrary when there is a written response question on a test it would be much easier for students to respond when they actually understand what they are talking about rather than just knowing the fact .

Another broader example is when we had to make a student commitee with the job of spreding out the word in school of aiding with recycling and cleaning up .
Many of us did it but I highly doubt that everyone understood why they where doing .

So in the end I believe for a student to get through his life experience as being a student with a degree of some sort , he has to understand idaes and concepts and act upon them .
