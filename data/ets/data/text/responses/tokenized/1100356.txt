I agree to the statement .
In my opinion there is famous saying that `` TO GET SUCCESS YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISK '' , i agree to this statement because i feel that success dosent come without taking risk in life .
Today is the world of competetion and to compete in this world you have to try new things to get success .

In order to get success , sometimes you try to find out new ways .
By going on those ways you think you can achieve success and you often take risk in your life .
i feel if people only do those things which they think know how to do well they can get success upto a certain level but can not reach heights of success .

In my opinion every one has its own defination of success and its depends on the person to person till what extent they can take risk in their own life , for some people success means peace of mind or a happy life .
But for some success means reaching the heights of the world , to conquer the world so that person tends to take more risk comparision to that that person who is happy in his own world , or to that person has different meaning for success .

For example , if you take the example of CRICKET if a batsmen wants to score quick runs he hast to play slodgy shots in order to take quick runs so he has to take risk .
sometimes he get success or sometimes he fails .
so its just depend on the person is he ready to take the risk in terms of getting success ?
But i dont think you can buy success without taking risk .

Sometimes i feel is `` SUCCESS HAS ITS NEGATIVE SIDE '' .
This question always bothers me a lot .
Is success dosent come without taking risk ?
Till now i am not able to find out the answer till date , may be i have not achieved success yet but the day when i will achieve succes i will come to know
