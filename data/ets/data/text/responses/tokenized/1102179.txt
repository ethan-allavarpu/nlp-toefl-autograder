Nowadays , cars are major means of transport .
They have been used for over 100 years .
Somehow , people are now addicted to cars .
It has become an essential thing in our everyday life .

Besides , it 's unlikely that people get rid of that mean of transport .
There is always something new to learn , to discover .
Cars might be technologically advanced in twenty years , but i hardly think there will be fewer cars in use .
In saudi arabia , people tend to use more and more cars , as every single family has , in average , 2 cars .

Actually , cars need maintenance , energy , fuel .
The only reason that could lead to the decreasing use of cars are the unsuffiecient quantity of petroleum .
As we all know , that ressource is limited on the Earth , and we could run out of fuel in 50 years .

However , the human being is known to be solution finder : we could probably invent new cars that work on another energy , for example the sun energy .
Actually , some of these cars are being tested all over the world .
That suggests the fact that there is always a solution for every problem .

In my opinion , i think cars are very useful , even though they make air pollution .
It has served the man for centuries .
But , eventually , if there is no more petroleum , cars are useless .
That natural factor could be the major reason of the usingless of that mean of transport .

In conclusion , that statemnet is wrong if there is not that natural factor that stops us from providing energy to make our cars work .
