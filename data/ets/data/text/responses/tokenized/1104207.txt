How would you react if an adult tells you that he was more happy when he was a child ?
Does it mean that becoming an adult , dissipate happiness and good times ?
According to my own experience , i think that people were getting happier when they were children .
They just live how there mind guide them trough without thinking about consequences .

Firstly , I think that young people are happier than adults because they do not care about anything materials .
They live their life without thinking about the consequences .
Indeed , everything they wanted to do is possible , so they just have to realise what their hearts tell them to do .
People are used to say that mankind are lead by money and interest , contrary to children who are only guide trough life by happiness and pleasure .
For example a young boy does not care about what his mum is doing .
But her mum must take care of her baby , and she has to safe ihim and protect him from dangers .

we can also say that young people are in good heealth that able them to live their life without money problems , job problems and more . ..
They spend most of their time playing with their friends without being disturbing .

According to my own experience , i can say that being a child is the best period of your life .
You do not have to care about anything than just playing outside .
You are not stress by your destiny and by the world around you .
But saying that adults do not enjoy their life is wrong but it is a question of priority , yopu hqve less think to count of .
