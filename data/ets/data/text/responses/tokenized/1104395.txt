Many people lose thier life , thier job , or maybe thier family .
All of them were not learn from other 's fault .
Successful person who has many choses that help him in his life .
So , what we lose if we learn one more thing in our life .
Actually , by learning from the life we come more open minded .

We read every day about the most ritch people in the world and all of them are the example for successful person .
They have a job beside some buisness .
They know that the life is difficult , so they learn every day how to extand thier own .

I agree with this statement , because I have a personal experince in this field .
Long time ago , after I graduted from Univesity , I was looking for the best career form me with a high salary .
So , after while I found what exactly I want .
It was was a good position in a commomn company in my country .
I got a perfect salary every month , but I was asking myself is it really enogh to reach to my goal ?
Actually , no , because I have to save some money preparing to my weeding day .
I have to buy house , car , and puy for the day .
After a while I decided to join to the stock market .
It was the risk step that I ever take it in my life .
Also .
it is really good to learn about new thing and how to successed .

I came to U. S. to get Master Degree , but not in my same major .
My major is Mining Engineering and I will study here Environmental Engineering .
I do that to have more than one chance .
I can work in Mining field or Environmental as well .

In conclusion , the person could be successed in his life , but he will not lose anything if he try to learn a new thing .
In addition , the life by itself teach us a lot of things every day just we have to open our mind .
