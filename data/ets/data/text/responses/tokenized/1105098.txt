most people have lost thier interest about thier communities day by day .
people also do n't want to involve in helping thier communities .
So it seems to me that these people that i am accused not of helping their comminities are specailly youngsters .
However , I ca n't accuse them directly since the sense of helping poeple around us should be taugth in their early education such as in elemantary schools .
Moreover families should be take care of this issue .

The first point that i would like to make is that if you are willingto help your community you should n't wait earning money .
As a result young people think that helping to other people or partipating in some charlty organization is waste of time .
However thinking like that it is not their fault yet their families do n't talk with their children about the importance of helping to people .
Moreover teachers or school department do n't encourage the youngster to help their comminities .
For instance when I was in highschool , our teacher encourage us to go to the house for elderly .
Furhermore they were bringing us to the forest in order to culture a tree in everymonths .
But the school stopped doing this activities because of its cost .
In addition I am conviced that young people ca n't understand the benefits of helping their communities .

Let us look another reason why younsters do n't help their communities .
I believe that their circulum in the school is so busy .
They have to study and they have to pass their classes .
It is apparent that those responsibilities are stressing them out .
However They can help their comminities in their spare times .
I am convinced that most youngsters spend their time playing video games , chatting internet or interesting in celebrities ' lives .
they can take a action in some helping organization instead of doing these activities .

To sum up , I agree with young people do n't help their comminitiees as much as they should .
But , the most importanly , it is not their fault .
Some shoul teach them the importanceof participating to help their comminities such as their parents and their teachers .
