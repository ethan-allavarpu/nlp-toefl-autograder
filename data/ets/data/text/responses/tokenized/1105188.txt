i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
it has lot of advantages like u do n't need to be panicked in a foreign country , the tour guide will direct you to all worth sight seeign places and provide you the background information about the same .

the comfort and security offered while travelling with a group is better than travelling on your own . .
u build new friendships and see different facets of life .
moreover the cost of the trips are realtively less since most of the guides/operators have tie ups with diffrent resorts , transportation companies etc . ..
it gives a better deal for the consumers .
your trip is organized and any problems arising can be dealt by the guide since he is a seasoned and experienced in the trip .

However , there are few disadvantages even .
we may/may not get individual attentions during the trip by the guide .
if he has many tourists under him .
sometimes a consumer may also feel that he is not gettign a raw deal i.e. not a good deal and its expensive because the tour operators margin ( commision ) will be added to the package costs .

Immaterial of the disadvantages , i feel that the best way to travel is ina group led by a guide since you tend to enjoy more and any hassles realting to foreign exchange visas etc are dealt with effectivey etc . .

Anyways , as the saying goes ,

`` The More the Merrier ''
