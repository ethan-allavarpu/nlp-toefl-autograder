Education is ongoing for our entire life .
In addition , it is commonly known that education at school is one of the most important parts of continuous education of life .
I am totally agree with the statement that is `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts `` with two reasons .

My first reason comes from the fact that is it is impossible to give all ideas and information at school .
That is , because of the limited time , you can not teach every thing to students at school .
That 's why , students must be provided to understand ideas and concepts .
For example , last year I took a mathematics class and we discuss about theories of a certain subject .
There were plenty of theories to study but the class was once per week for a semester .
The professor provided us to understand the subject completely , afterwards , we could handle other theories by ourselves .

My second reason is that we educated at school to have some ideas to practise into our life after school .
If we understand ideas and concepts at school , we can have a change to apply them into the rest of our life .
Hence all information and ideas can be valued to worth our time that is spend at school .
To give a specific example , I am a professional female now , and last week I met a realy complex problem at work .
A studying at university with my mathematics project helped me surprisingly .
Because that time , I really understood the idea in the project .
I also felt that I was not regret for the time that I spend at university .

To sum up , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts to give a hand to them for their future .
Finally it must the main point for education at school .
