I 'm agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people .
The young are happier , have more energy , and do n't think to much in the consecuenses of an action .
Young people like to enjoy life , going to the movies , beaches , parties , going to ride bike , traveling , listening to the music , dancing and a lot of more activities .
They want to be happy .
Old people usually have less energy to do a lot of things than the young peolple can do .
When you are old may be your healt is not the same and you has to expend time going to the doctors , therapy , going to the farmacy for medicines and be at home for more time whith responsabilities to do , work , grandchildrens to take care .
You think more is you want to going to a place .
Young people and old people have a different way to think about live , resposabilitis and having fun .
Old people are more conservatives .
Most of young people just think in having fun whith their friends and most of the old people just think about work or rest .
