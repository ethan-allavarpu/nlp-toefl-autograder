Nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping communities .

I desagree about that .
There are many reasons why i desagree .
First , it shoul n't say a generality .
There are lot of young people who help our communities .
For example , when Katrina destroyed Louisina and Alabama , young peolpe helped this citys , they had organized a basketball game of charity , with the NBA players .

An other example , young people help old person and give enough time instead of to play football or go to the shopping .
Nowadays , young people give enough time for their communities , they organiz party for the children , take time in the hospital to give their help .
They create association to beat the A.I.S.D , poverty and the childrens in the hospital who had not money .

Often youngs stars back to do a show for bring money for asscociation and for to build house , park , stadium .

Finally i think young people work enough for thier cmmu
