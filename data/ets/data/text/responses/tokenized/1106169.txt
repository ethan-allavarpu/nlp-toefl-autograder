The big exchange

through the huge use of planes now adays I start to feel that the cars will be history .

in spite of the large number of cars , the planes numbers in growing .
since the first flight over the ocian people began to love the plane speed and to save times in travels .

in planes the people do n't get tired of driving or even make an accedent which usually found in cars .

also planes can transport a large quantity of things and in no time , and that we really miss in cars .

and the big reason that in the air there are no traffic jams ( at least until now ) .

all of the reasons above will make the people think of travel in planes , or even own thier private plane which is ussually smaller then the ordinary planes .

with all these benefits , the people still feeling worried about traveling in plans instead of cars .
Since 11/9 people began to think of the worst thing can happen to them which is kidnapping , but this feeling begins to be history in now adays .

the planes accedents are much smaller in number than accedents with cars which make the people feeling comfortable .

I thing in 20 years the airports will be more and more the planes on the other hand will develop and pilots schools will be opened to ordinary peoples .
many shapes and models of planes will appear , many companies will exchange thier prouduction of ars into planes for example : i think we will see a nice GMC plane or even a toyota plane ...

there will be also small airfield near almost every street .

the use of car will be like riding horses now !
and the most exiting thing is to have your own plane , airport and passengers .

there will be a taxi planes

and that what i call it :
