In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I agree with this statement .
The reason is simple .
Now there is too muche pollution .
If we want to save the world we must reduce the pollution and one way is the reduction of the cars in use .
We must implement ecological alternatives .

Earth is collapsing , too much pollution .
One of the most important factor of high pollution is the presence of many cars .
cars are becomed a mass way of transport and in many cities it is used in the wrong way , for example one car is used only by one man instead of three or four .
We must change that .
It is not difficult .

We must improve our behevior toward ecologic problems .
One way for example is using public transport .
by using pubblic transports there will bw fewer cars in use .
Fewer cars in use mean less pollution .
I 'm sure that is one of the reason that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .

I see a world in the future with less cars , less pollution , more attention to the environment .
I can see happy kids in big city parks , running and screaming , people with large smiles on its face .
May be it is only a dream , may be it is only a hope , it must be our future .

Changing ways of life is difficult and it has high costs but surely this is the straight way to follow .
