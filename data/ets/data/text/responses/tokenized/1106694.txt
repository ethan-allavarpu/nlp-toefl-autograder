But the people who are able to explain that ; ay be not able to explain how education can reduce violence in poor countries .

These experts are , I think , the ; ore able to teach thier knowledge .
It 's important that this knowledge does n't begin a sort of integrism .
Even if we are specialized on a subjects it 's important to understand other people point of view .

To conclude we can say that it 's important to have some experts on qcqde ; ics su
