it is not the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the given topic in itself is self explainatory .
because having broad knowledge of many acdemic subjects would be not be any use unless we command any one of them it is something like jack of all trades master of none .

the broad knowledge of many subjects would only let you know the subjects but to master any subject you have to specialize in one specific subject .
my point of veiw is to specialize in one subject to know many subjects because doing we will be in more depth of one then just be superficially attached to many this can be further elabaroting by taking certain e.g like a general doctor can treat many diseases but can struck in some critical disease where as specialist doctor can tke care of complex disease in his specialised branch .

same way in any other branch you take it a specialist would always have an upper on a non specialist today where the world devoloping at such a past pace the contribution of a specialist would be more than a non specialist specialist can help in higher research program vis-vis cant specialist can go in for extensive studies in his and can get fruitful results which can be used for the betterement of the human race as per the subject concern
