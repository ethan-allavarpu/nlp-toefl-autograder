A common idea is if you do n't take risk , you wo n't succeed .
Of course in our modern society the high number of people who want to succeed make the success more difficult to get .
And as a result you have to take some risk .
Nevertheless you have to be carefull because of the society you have to take risk but if you miss your objectif even with a fall short , the society wo n't forget it .
And you wo n't be a successful person ( for a long time at least ) .

At the contrary if you do n't take risk you wo n't be successful .
The society is always moving forward and if you want to follow and to succeed you can not remain and wait , without changing .
So if you are changing something you are taking a risk even if it 's a very small risk .
If you do n't adapt your business , your life or your job could get worse .

From my opinion a sucessful person took some risks , it 's compulsory .
There 's too many people and too many business on earth so if you want to suceed you have to take risks .
But the border between success and nothing or even something worse is very thin .
So you have to take risks but you have to be very carefull .
It means the more risks you take the more chances you have to succeed but as well higher will be the fall if you do n't succeed .

In conclusion i think in our society the only way to succeed is to take some risks but to be very carefull .
Because i think as well a very good way to loose everything is to take too many risk .
It means if you want to be successful you have to stay in the border between not enough risks and too many .
And i think the most successfull people keep this border very thin .
