Parents always say that you have to work very hard at your younger age , so as to enjoy your older age .
I do n't think that this is a valid deal cause I dont think that I will be able to enjoy more in my older days than when I am young .
Cause at older age you would like to settle down in a calm village and enjoy the peaceful and pleasant climate rather than living in a crowded city , with lot of things happening around you and that interests you .

At your younger age , you will have the energy to go around different places and view some of the beautiful creations in the world .
But when you become old , maybe your health will not allow you to do adventures .
At your younger age , you have many things to enjoy because of less responsibilities and more energy .
At young age you can also have a great enjoyment with your romantic life too .
Enjoying to the highest at your younger age and also working hard to get settled in the future is my moto of life .
Normally people think that they will enjoy there life after they are old and they only work .
But this can be harmfull if they dont get a chance to enjoy at thier older stage after so many years of hardwork .

Normally youngsters do enjoy a lot by arranging disco parties and trips to different locations with friends .
They get in touch with the latest technologies and gadgets like ipods , mobile phones , games and many more .
They do spend a luxurious life .
Youngsters also enjoy sports and have a abilitiy to take part in it .

So finally I can say that , young people enjoy more than older people with respect to health , responsibilties , technology and much more .
So , I prefer enjoying my younger age and getting settled in my older age .
