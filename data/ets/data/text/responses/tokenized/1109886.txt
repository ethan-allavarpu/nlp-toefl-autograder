I agree with this idea because of 4 reasons on it .
Color , sizes , words , and the feeling of people .
The first one is the color impression .
In fact , I am eaasily faked by this strategy .
For example , most advertisements , of course , have its specifis characteristics .
but my brain always get in color .
My composition of the brain is , at first , color , and then , the personality .
Even if the ability is bad , I often buy the product .

The second one is sizes .
In the bills , we can not know the size of the products .
This sometimes happens in case that buying something big or large ( refrigerator , car ) .
On the internet shopping , it is cheaper than usual shopping , however , this kind of shock can be easily occured .

The third one is words .
Words makes our heart dramatically change .
Take an example .
The cloth is 100 left in vintage shop .
50 clothes sell 1 or 2 for a day .
The owner is confused .
One day , he made a poster that written : The clothes are left only 50 !!

This made meaningful effect that the products are sold out for only 1day .
Like this instance , words are very significant in the advertisement activities .
The last one is feeling of people ( personality ) .
On the TV commercial , various famous person advertise many products .
In fact , the profits can become high and low by the person who is acting the CM .
