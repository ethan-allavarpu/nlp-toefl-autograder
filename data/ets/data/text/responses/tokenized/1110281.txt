Nowadays , people however their age , are selfish because of the values convey by the modern society and the capitalism values .

Indeed , everybody think about itself so young people have grown in this atmosphere of '' me and myself '' .
The life goes fast and we want to pursuit and achieve our plans because today everything is planning per advance and their is no time for a civic behaviour .
In addition , the globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix as their is more mixed communities people and there is an identication problem : which communities for which people ?
Regarding to the recent events , communities are rivals and fight between them .
So , their is no unity in this world why young people would change this by help who and with which means ?

The modern life make young people very nacisic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be usefull .
Some will help the oldest and desabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them .
Others will comme in an association to create a better life place for their community .

Indeed some association and organisation have social aim in which young want to be involve .

In my case , I really want to represent the Black in France because their is a lack of representativeness even on media , fashion , intellectual and scientist work .
So I went to Boucle d'Ebene association which promote African and Caribean entrepreuneurs even if I have my studies and different thing to manage before to help them .

To conclude , I agree with the fact that they is a lack of motivation by young people to involve themselve in social and civic activities to help their communities .
In fact , they seem to be over booked by they stuff as school , work , friends , early child . ..

Indeed , nowadays young people have much more responsabilities than fifty years ago !
But the reality is that they is a lot of young which want to change some things in this world by giving time to helping their community .
However , sometimes they do n't have the means to achieve their project as to create an association or a company and sometimes , they are dissuaded by the loss ricognition and credit they are given .
