I totally agree with the statement which states `` it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
According to me , To understand ideas and concepts are more important for a student than to learn facts .
firstly , to understand the topic for example any topic related to physical science like light .
We should know the basic concepts to deal with it and basic ideas like to think ourselves from where actually it is coming i think thats enough to understand the topic .
concepts should be more clear like various laws of reflection and rarefraction to use them for further study not about the facts that from where it is orignated etc etc .

After seeing the student prospective we should be clear with the concepts first and the basic ideas like for example taking the ` brain where its never been before about the topic ' .
These genrated thought called as ideas .
Generating ideas are really brain storming technique which help to increase the morale of a student .

Similarly if a student go in search of a fact there are 9 out of 10 times he will fail .
This failure will lead to lower in the morale of a student through which feeling of negativity can comes in his/her mind .
This will lead to build up of negative attitude which can hamper his/her future also .
Facts are those which we go and try to find after completing our bachelor 's or even after masters .
Therefore , at a student age we should only learn the concepts involved .

One more thing i would like to add to make my assumption stronger is that when we appear in any subjective class at school/college level .
what our teacher main aim or where they more stress .
They stress more on concepts building system then to go in search of a fact .
i agree that facts are also required we should know but major focussig point should be concepts and develope student to think beyond the limit .

At the end in a nut shell i would like to say that concepts are the one which makes student more clear about the topic able to judge it properly .
these concepts are the major supported element in a student life which help him/her to think more , to create/generate ideas , to be able to get the thing done in more fruitfull way which are basically needed academically and in professional life to .
