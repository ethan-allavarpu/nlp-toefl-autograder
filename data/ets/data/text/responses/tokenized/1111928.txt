As the competiton increased belong the companies in almost every market , advertisiment become a very important way to improve the sales numbers .
Companies use a lot of diffirent advertisement techniques .
Accordingly It generally causes to make their products seem much better than they are actually .

For example when you watch a girl eating a canddy or a chocolate you probably want to eat that product as soon as possible .
When you go and buy one then you understand that it is not as much delicious as you desired , but unfortunetly you have almost bought that product and this has increased the companies sales once more .

On the other hand some companies are aware of that , this will happen only one time .
When you use and see the product does n't as good as seemed in the advertisement then you lost your trust to that company and never buy its products again .
So they are triying to show the true qualities of the product for not making the customers dissappointed .
When they are n't dissapointed , they always prefer to buy their products .

In conclusion , some advertisements may show the products better than what they exactly are , for improving the sales .
But some firms can think different from that and plans long time process of its activities .
I think the better way is always telling the truth .
In that way people can trust your company , buy your products and in the future according to the high sales ' your company will most probably be a permanent company .
