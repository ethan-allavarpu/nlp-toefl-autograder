In my personal experience , i agree that it is the best way to go on travel in a group that led by a tour guide .
There were lots of advantages of go in a group .
In this short essay , i will discuss with reasons and examples that why is traveling the best way within a group .

First of all , we can make a lots of friends during the trip .
When we are on an airplane , a train , a boat or a bus .
We can all commiuncate with each others , and having fun .
One of my best friends , who names Kim , i met him the first time in a bus on a trip with a group to HangZhou , he just sits next to me , and we sarted to talk to each other , after all we became the best friends .
So that traveling in a group can make friends .

Secondly , it is well organize by traveling with a tour guide .
He/She could led you to the most popular and interesting place that the touriest always likes to go to .
For example , if i go to place by my self that i never went on before , i wil totally get lost , and do not know where to stay and where to go and where to eat . ..
so on .
But if i go there with a group and with a tour guide , the things will totaly be changed .

Last but not least , we can get more fun by traveling in a group .
For example , if i go to a place individually , i will get bord on the airplane or train .
In the other hand , it will be more interesting and funny by traveling in a group , because sometimes we can talk about some funny stories or interesting personal experience on the trip , so we would not get bord .

In conclusion , i discussed the reasones and examples that why is travelng the best way in a group and b y a tour guide .
In my opinon , i would like to travel in a group , cause i can make new friends during the trip .
