Nowadays young people has change a lot , their education changes and they changes with it , is suposse to be a more liberal educacion with less rules and more freedom , but maybe we are giving freedom to people that is not ready to use it properly yet .

What I wanted to say with that is that young people today spends more time looking at themselves than trying to be part of the society .

Maybe is because they are living in a society that do not offers them what they are looking for and for that reason the are not in the mood to participate of their communities .

We are living in the telecomunications era .
You can live without human touch .
Without going out of your own house .
Most of young people thinks that his communiti is to small for them so they use internet to feel they are part of something really great , to feel importans .
They do not mind if his neighbour needs salt or if his hometown is clean or not .
They are upon all that .

As an example I can use new kind of culture that I have red about in a magacine last week .
It is a new way of life , it is very extended in Japan , and their philosophy of life is not to have any personal relation if it is not via internet .
So they borke off whit their families and with their friends and they star living all by themselves .
Using internet for everything , for working , make their shoping , make friends and all the natural things that we are use to do in our lives .

Hearing thing like that I have got the hoppe that maybe in the future young people will help their communities , maybe they would be cybercommunities but the main idea is to be part of something .
