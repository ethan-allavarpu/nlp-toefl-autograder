In these days a lot of people especially old people claims young people do not heve enough time to helping their communuties .
The old people around me are complaining the same problem .
However , i do not share their idea .
In my opinion young people tries to give time to help the charity but they have n't got enough time because of the rush oh the twentieth century , Young people heve a lot of work to do but not enough time to spent in this century .
However they spent a lot of time to their communities , For instance they are visiting their familiy in every celebration .
If they have they gave it to the poof people .
For example last night in a television show a lot of people gave money to a charity to plant trees and most of people who gave money to charity were young people .
Actually There was n't any old people there , This an remarkable point , a lot of people say young people are guilty about this topic but may be old people are guilty There is an adage which comes from hitits , In a hitit paper an old people was complaining about young peoples .
it shows that complaining from young people has never changed , The people living in twenty second century may be complain from ypung peoples too , However it does n't mean young peoples are not gining enough time , In conclusion , the young people living in twentieth century gives enough time to their comunity , even they have got a lot of jobs to do , we can see the from the television shows or if we look at histoery we will see the same complainings , this is typicall thing so the old people has to get r 'd of the'r complainings ,
