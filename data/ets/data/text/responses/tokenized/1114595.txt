I fully agree to that statement because of the following reasons .
First , an already successful person will accept a higher risk because he has a larger security if he fails .
When the new thing produces loss he still has the gains of the successful working actions he did before .
So he has a lower risk than a person who could lose everything by experimenting with new things .

Secondly , the hunger for success grows with the success one has .
A successful person knows there has to be more than the already achieved .
The known old patterns will only provide the known old amount of success .
But to increase it there have to be found new unknown and maybe also unfamiliar kinds of ways which mostly have a higher risk but also a higher possible gain than the conventional ones .
If someone has a risky character he will not stop at the first success but look for more the whole life .

The third and i think most important argument deals with experience with fear of the future .
If a person were successful at least once in his or her life by taking a risk he or she has made an important step .
By crossing the border in one 's own mind once the next time it will be easier because you get a kind of imagination what ist waiting for you on the other side .
Of course there is no possible calculation with all risks , there will always be some one did not think about .
Despite of that the person knows how to deal with developments that can not be foreseen , so he or she has no or at least less fear of them .

Thes arguments show , why success on a high level is not possible without risks at a high level and therefore i agree with the given statement .
