An increasing number of students realize that it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts , Unfortunately , there is a growing opposition among the other students , who maintain that learn facts is the most factor in their studies .
However , in the final analysis , I conclude that the former one does make sense .
In the following discussion , I would like to present some point to support my statement .

In the first place , the key point for my view is that understand ideas and concepts , undoubtly , which allow the students to cultivate their ability of self-study is play the most role in their studies .
Actually , the final aim of the students study in the university is to promote their sense of think independence .
For exam , in their beginning studies , they need a teacher to guide them .
But in their future studies , they must deal with the problems by themselves .
Of course , they need to practice their capability to solve the problem when they understand ideas and concepts in class .

In addition , the students can understand ideas and concept by themselves to check out what they have learnd in the class .
It is benefit for them to build up their self-confidencial .

Furthermore , It is the best way to supervise the students .
If they ca n't understand and concepts , they would failed the exam at last .

Given the reasons above , which sometimes intertwine to form a organic whole and thus become more persuasive , and we can arrived at the conclusion that inspire the students to master the ability of understand ideas and concepts in the class must be undertaken by the teachers .
Only by this way can we implement the qutity-education ; only by this way can we enhance the self-confidence of the students and only by this way can we supervise students ' study in an efficient way .
