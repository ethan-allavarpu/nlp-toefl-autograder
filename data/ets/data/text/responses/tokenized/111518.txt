Every research about advertisements or advertised products indicated that advertisemments has power to manipulate the people 's thoughts regarding products .

In our Tv or Show Business times , many celebreties or popular people have been created by our Media , and it should be acceptted that we love this popular people and grant importance their ideas .
So the company use and benefits from this situation .

I believe that if a one loves the Micheal Jackson and and saw the Micheal Jackson in the Pepsi 's advertisements , after this instance , Pepsi strongly take its place his or her mind .

Secondly , Advertisements introduces the products withhout presting their pejorative sepeciliaties .
For instance if buy the microwave oven , you can not nuke something it near the baby or radition sensitive people .
But it is impoosible to see any warning regarding microwave radition in the advertisements .

In Sum , Advertisements is very powerfull tools for affecting people ' thoughts about specific product .
