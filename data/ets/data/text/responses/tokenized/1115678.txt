How does someone enjoy life at all ?
What do you need in order to enjoy life ?
Young people usually have less problems .
Especially when they are very young they dont have much to worry about .
Everything they should worry about is already been taking care of by their parents .
And they do n't even have a sense or a feeling yet for issues that are uncertain and one could worry about .
Since worrying is a stopper and is something that slows down enjoyment very young people enjoy life more that older in that respect .

But to really enjoy something you have to be not only of no worries but you also have to aprecciate the action that you are performing , the situation that you are into and so on .
Young people having less experience in life and due to good partens less experience in unhappy and unsatisfied time of life can not aprecciate things to the extend adults do .
Someone once said : You dont know that sugar is worth unless you have tasted salt .
Older people have tasted salt .
So they know how to aprecciate when tasting sugar .

Enjoying life can also mean to accomplish the dreams that you have .
This can be a certain style of life with having a wife and children , a good job or a something materialistic .
First of all young people do not have access to certain areas like a good job , are not able to drive a car yet and when they are able to they mostly can not afford their dream car due to the lack of financial means .
Again if they are really young they might not even think of these things and so they wo n't miss them .
But as soon as they get older they have all kinds of dreams and much of them are not fullfiled in the near past since young people dont have the money or age or knowledge for it .
Older people however had a fairly good time of their lives to work towards their dreams .
They are more likely to be in a stage that they at least could accomlish the most urgent dream , the one that was really important to them for all of their lives .

This enjoyment however can again be stopped .
This is the case when older people look past and remember the things the didnt achive rather then the ones they did .
Young people do not often look backwards that way .
They remember the good thinks first .

In addition to that in an unsatisfied situation young people are happy again with so little .
For example when a child drops his icecream it will start to cry .
But as soon as he gets a new one it will not only stop to cry but be happy again and smile .
An adult might be thinking about wasting money all day long , about his goofyness and lets the bad occasion erase the good one that he finally has a new icecream .

I can not agress or disagress with the statement as a whole .
For me it depends on the atitude of the person .
But when it is someone that is looking forward and recognizing his achievements then he enjoys his life more than anyone else .
