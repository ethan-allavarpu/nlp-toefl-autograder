Nowadays there is a discussion about the youngsters .
It is that recently , do young people give enough time to helping their comunities ?
In my opinion , young people do not give enough time to helping to their communities , as it was at past .
At our time , there are lots of things that youngsters can waste their time with .

Firstly , most of the young people are wasting time with computers .
Computers were made for people 's goods at first but then it starts to become a toy or a game machine and no one tried to stop it , because games are a seriously large echonomic resource for the people working in this sector .
For example , young people can try using computer and internet for searching for the informations about their country 's place in the world and feature predictions about their country .
Further more this interest would make the young people more interested in their communities .

Secondly , I think that younng people are not taking the lessons at their schools so seriously .
There are important lessons given to the student at school about their communities like history and geography .
In my opinion , every person , related to a community , should know his country 's history .
Also geography is an important factor for a person to help his/her community .
These are just two factors for a person to help his/her community that the educations of them are given at school .
Moreover school gives the education of loving your country , after your family .
These are all well known by people , but , however , still people are not taking seriously and thinking schools as gamefields .

Young people are like diamonds .
You should shape them , otherwise you can not expect anything from them .
They have to be shaped , if they are wanted to be the savers of the community .
So if a youngster does n't give enough time to help his/her community , it is also his/her family 's fault .
