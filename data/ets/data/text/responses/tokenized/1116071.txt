Personally , I agree with the statement ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' .
There will be many people disagreeing with this , but there are three major reason to convince .
Those three are health , knowledge , and transportation .

First reason I think this way is because younger people have better health than older people .
I was playing in the beach with my relatives .
My cousins and I were running , splashing , swimming , and surfing .
It was a lot fun for us , as everyone agree .
Suddenly , My aunt called us to come out .
It was big surprise for us .
She called us because my grandfather has fainted .
As a result , old people has bad health to enjoy their life .

Second one is that younger people has different knowledge than that of older people .
Most of my age ( 14 ) people know a lot of entertaining place , and fun place .
Eventually , olders ca n't go out broadly , because they do n't know many place to go .
This was my friend 's grandparents story .
It was hot sunny day , and they were retired from their work so they ahve a lot of time to go out .
So , they wanted to go out some where , but they could n't .
They phoned my friend , and asked her where to go , I was little bit surprised at first , but I understand that they had different lifestyle than us back where they were young like us .

Last reason that I agreed with the statement is because we have better transportation .
Altough , grandparents have lots of time , some of them can not drive , because they had totally different lives compare to us .
Nowadays , most of the university student can drive because it 's widely used , but old people did n't have chance to learn the driving .
Also , younger ones can ride buses , subways , and skytrains .
Unfortunantely , olders ca n't go by standing , they have to sit down some where , but sometimes public transportation does n't have enough spot for them to sit down .

In conclusion , youngs can enjoy life better than olders .
It does n't mean that every elders all like these , but a lot of proportion of them are like this .
I think enjoy life when we are young , and enjoy more quieter and relaxing life is better for elders .
