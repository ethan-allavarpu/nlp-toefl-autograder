In the fast growing world job opportunities are growing .
All the subjects have sub-subject to work on it or new working areas .
Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well because of ; earning money and reputation , peoples attention and being imaginative .

First , earning money and reputation is the base of all kind of work and success .
People always want money and reputation , at least one of them .
Trying something new will always bring you the money or the raeputation .
For example if whe think about a good car mechanic , and known by his own neighbourhood stats working on luxury boats engines .
A while later his customers will start to want his help in boat subject or something else about mechanics because they will think that he is gifted about mechanical things .
So trying new things brings you both money and reputation and these two courages to try more new things again .

Secondly , people 's attention makes you happy bacause everbody ask you something about the thing you have done or invented , wants something about it or come near to you and say ` congratulations` .
The point is that you are the center of the world at that moment , you think that everything happening is about you everyone loves you everyone needs you , this is the food of the human soul and the key for t the success so peoples attention is one of the most important points of trying or doing new things .

Last , only imaginative people may try new things because they are the ones who try the not-tried things before .
Their brains are succesfull until their birth , may be they are really gifted or the ` one` .
They can assemble a world only for theirselves and kive in it .
When they imagine something they can also imagine the result .
What does that change ?
If they do not see the succes at the end , they do not go in to the new things , their brain is working in a different way , they are smart .

In conlusion , trying new things and the success related to it is about money , attention and being imaginative .
People trying new things can be succesful but sometimes only succesful people can try new thing because they already have enough courage and brain for that .
This is a two directed road , someone in this road will be olways successful or always try new things .
And it will end with the other one .
