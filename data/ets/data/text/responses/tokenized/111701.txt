This assey is going to accomplish and reply to the question .
Do I agree or disagree to the statement , The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
From my point of view i disagree .
I am supporting to travel in a small group , alone or just accompany by my girlfriend .

Their are several reasons to confirm my opinion .
At first your are not depending on a timetable the guide offered .
I 'd like to plan my traveling on my own .
If you stay at a beautiful place , you can keep staying and not to move forward with the group .
Within a group there are alway different point of views , some would move faster and some like to stay .
You are not flexible .
Further a guided tour is always more expensive then a own organized tour .
And anyway , with the new internet time and the research possibility , you can find all relevant informations in the internet or guid books like lonely planet gives also all necessary information about sight , cities and historical backround .

As per own experiences you meet a lot of different people from all over the world during the journey .
This experience is sometimes more important than the sight itself .
You can also get lots of information from other travelers .

Guides are usually visit most famous places and this places are most likely very crowded .

In a nut shell , i 'd like to be more flexible and save money .
You never know wheter you like a particular place or not and to spend money to stay at a place I do n't like to only because of a groups decission , this sounds not realy like holiday .

To plan the journey is also a very beautiful experience I
