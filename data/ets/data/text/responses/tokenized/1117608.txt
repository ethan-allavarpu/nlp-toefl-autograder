Sucess and failure lies in the hand of the person andalso depends on the the dedication and effort which he gives on his particular work .
I feel that succesfull people does different things and enjoy doing doing them .
These people generally dont depend on the result of the work which was done by them but they concentrate on the effort which put on it .
This the best and most fascinating thing in them .
When they donot try new things and work stick to one kind of work which they are habituated to do which any risks and problems the man would certainly not called as a successful person .

For example take a biologist resercher , he starts reasearch in one particular feild and conduct experiments draws hypothisis and he continues the process till he succeed .
He go for expedations and also do many adventures to study the nature of a particular species and draw conclusions by observing the behaviour of differnt animals in that species .
His journey would be certainly though and it also take long time to make conclusion , if his conclusion is right and matched he is succeesful in his reaserch , but he donot stop till he will reaserch on another species and his life goes on .
If he is confied to one particular reserch in his life time that would be that effective as things goes on changing and the species can adapt to differnt environment so he had to succed further .

The same is the case of a bussiness manager or a owner of a bussiness .
A bussiness man is succesful in the coprate world with his product and ones a lot of profit with this product , but he will not be restricted to make that particular product only he would certainly do experiments and launch new products , if the product clicks he is succeesful but if the product doesnt click still he would be succeesful and would try to make implications on that .

Another thing is succes doesnot lie in doing a routine job , everyone should experiment and do differnt things as there is a lot in the world to still learn and we can come through them .
If we are not succesful in any of the experiments we did it doesnt matter to do the experiments we get through the subject and we can then finnaly have a pool of knowledge on differnt fei
