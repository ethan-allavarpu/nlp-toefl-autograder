Some people try to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , while others wish to specialize in one specific subject .
I believe it is more preferable to first have vast knowledge .

First , knowledge is good for my children .
If I have more knowledge , I will be able to educate my children better .
My father used to teach me things that I did not learn at school .
For example , my school did not teach why water is formed around a glass of cold water .
I was always curious about it , and it was my fater who told me the answer .
As my father taught me , I want to do the same thing to my children .

In addition , the chances of getting a job increase .
Let 's say that I took geometry , biology , and psychology in college .
Although I did not specialize in one subject , I still have a lot of information in each subject .
I can be a math teacher , a worker in biological museum , or a guidance counselor at middle school .
What will happen if I specialized only in geometry ?
Once I can not be a geometry teacher , I will have nothing to do , but just wait .

Finally , I can pick a subject and specialize in it later .
I will experience and evaluate the subjects while I learn many subjects .
After the education , I will have a pretty good idea which subjects fit my interests .
Using the same example as before , let 's assume that I became very interested in biology .
People say there is no end to learning ; I will not hesitate to take biology again and go deeper into it .

In conclusion , I think learning a variety of subjects is important , because it allows me to teach my children , get a job , and specialize in subject that is suitable for me .
