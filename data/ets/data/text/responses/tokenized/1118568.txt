There are many advanges in any field of knowledge .
They have some connection with each other .
If students only learn one specific area that will be misunderstood some parts of academic subjects .
In my opinion , I agree with people are better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

Some academic subjects need students know the others subjects first .
Otherwise , they could not totally understnad its meaning or how to figure out the answer .
For example , students have to know mathemtic class first and then they can use it on the accounting class .
On the other hand , If People have broad knowledge , they can understnad the newspaper what they talk .
They also can join any kind of topic to share their opinion .
If people only concentre on their area that will be lost many chance to know new friends .

People specialize in one area that 's good for their careers in the future because they can deeply understnad their professionl knowledge .
As the matter fact , after graduation , people can gain more specific knowledge when they work .
It would be better than learn specific knowlege in school so they do n't need to focus on it .
If students learn specific subject in university , they will lost oppontunity to gain more than others areas .
