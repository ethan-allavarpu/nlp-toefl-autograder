In these days , college have many programes to offer for students .
Each student has different opinion about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects thand to specialize in one specific subject .
Personally , I think to have specialize in one specific subject can much achievment for the goal .

Fistly , if you learn many things academic subjects , you can not learn deeply .
For instance , when I was high school student , I learned lot of things during the three years .
I could not concentrated one subject because there are too much topic so , I can not find related each subject .
Therefore , it does not help me to learn many subjects so , I prefer to learn just one subject .
It can be more concentrate for me .

Secondly , in these days , we have specialize person for each division parts .
When you know broad things and does not know specific about their subject , you can not do anything in our society .
Many people do the best their own subject and they are become speciall person who knows really well about their own department .
If you concentrated just one subject and learned lots of things , you can help people who wants to need to you .
However , if you learned lots of subjects , you did not get specific lessons from that subjects .

Lastly , we do not have lots of time to learn everything during the life .
We have lots of subject aroud us and if you choose one subject you should concentrated that because we do not have much of times to learn just one subject too .
For example , I am nusing students so , I always think about care for patient and learned lots of things for patient .
I do not have much of time to learn lots of subject because , I am not perfectly to learn whole one subject .
One subjects has lots of things so , I decided learn only one things .
When I all in the nusing , I can improve my care skills .
Therefore , I will be a better nurse when I will graduated .
I think , to concentrated one subject , can be make more specialize their own position .

To conclude , there are many subject in our life .
Everyone wants to learn everthing but we can not learn everything because each subject has lots of material .
In my opinion , learn to specialize in one specific subject is the better than have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because , if you concentrated just one subject , you can be learn lots of things deeply .
