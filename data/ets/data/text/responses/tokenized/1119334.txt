It is debatable whether traveling alone is the best way to travel that by a tour guide .
Some people might recommend to travel alone a least once in order to have alone time to sort out our think and relieve stress by having peace away from their heavy load of taks .
However , I firmly believe that go on a trip alone is not the best way to travel because there are many dangerous vacation spots and it is time consuming .

First of all , traveling in a group of people with tour guide is much safer .
It is a tour guid who knows well about the vacation spots based on their previous experience by living the place for a long time .
we not only obtain accurate information that the place we should not go but also be protected with a members of group by moving with a lot of people .
Therefore , by traveling with a group of people led by tour guide allows people not to face unexpected situation including lose their money by lobberies , meet gangsters and lose their way .
For example , when I traveled Hong Kong alon two years ago , I went to the opposit direction to the park that I had planned to go .
I could not speak chinese so , I could not ask anything to the people around me .
I felt scared and cried all they long .

In addition , traveling with tour guid in a group is much time saving .
This is because poeple does not have to make a schedual researching the information about famous place by comb through all the books and call all the hotels to reserve .
Poeple just follow guided direction withouth worring to check the time schedule of transportation , wherher the hotel reservation is available or not .
Without worring those things , people can spend more enjoyable time with goup of people by talking about their feelings and sharing impressions each other .
To demonstrate , according to the research conducted of Labor of Korea in 2007 , 75 % people felt more memorable and enjoyable trip when they traveled with a group of poeple by tour guide .
In addition , they answered that the reason why they felt happy with the trip is they does not have to worris about the information making trip .

For these reasons , traveling with a group of people is more advantageous to make their trip more fun because of the time and feeling of sager .
I belive that people should take into account those things before they go on the trip alone .
