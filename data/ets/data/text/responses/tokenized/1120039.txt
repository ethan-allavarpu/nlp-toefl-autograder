In my opinion , I agree that traveling with a group of people led by a tour guid is the best way to travel .
There are several good reason why I agree with having a tour guid during the travel .
First of all , when you will decide to go to a foreign country that you have not ever visit it , you will face some difficulties and a little bit of fear .
All of these troubles that you will be faced because of the worryness and anxiety for this trip .
Also , may be because you do n't have enough required information about that country .
So you need some one to help you about the places , shopping malls , good restuarant , lacation of some hotels and so on .
According to these challenges , the bast way to keep away these trouble is to travel in a group led by a tour guide who have enough information about the counry more than what you have .
Second reason why I personaly prefer that because I think it is safer for you and your family .
I rememberd when I and my family traveled to Italy , we encountered some criminals and drug people who we do n't know how to deal with them .
However , although my father had solve this problem , I think if we had a guid with us that will be more easy for us .
The third and last reason is we choose to travel to have some relax and have a rest away our works , duties and responsibilities .
Actually , if you want to do that you should be away from all these troubles that , of course , you will be facing it such as ask some citizen people to have some information about as I said in the begining `` where can I find this hotel ? '' , `` where are the recreation centers ? '' , `` what is the best restuarant do you have here ? '' and lots of these dum questions .
You may also do not know how to speak their language since you are not a native speaker .

In short , personally I prefer to travel with a tour guide to keep away all of these headach .
