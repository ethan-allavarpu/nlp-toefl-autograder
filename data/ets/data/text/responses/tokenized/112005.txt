I agree with the statement mentioned that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
If students learn only facts then they do n't have conceptual knowledge or idea that where and how to use in practical .
For example , a maths teacher taught one problem and solved without giving the concept of that problem like formula , method or steps to perform to solve the problem .
This will be difficult for the students , if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination .
They can not solve the problem as they do n't know the concept of the problem given .
So a maths teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the students keep the concept remembered , so that they can easily solve the any problems based on that concept .

For every problem there will be a concept behind to solve it .
Another example as , if we see the physics book there will be lots of concepts for each and every chapter .
In that there is a chapter calle `` GRAVITATION '' .
In this the idea is about the Earth 's gravitation .
Due to gravity whatever the things thrown in the air from earth 's surface it will fall on the earth again because of gravitational pull of the earth .
If we say to the students that the things which were thrown in the air from earth will fall back to the earth 's surface , then they just learn the fact .
They do n't know the reason .
Due to this type of learning none of the students will not become good engineers or any other professionals .
Because lack of concepts and practical knowledge .

Even if we take a civil engineer student who do n't know how to build the building and where to build then definitely the building will be collapse .

That is why , it is important for the students to learn concepts and understand the ideas rather than to learn facts .
