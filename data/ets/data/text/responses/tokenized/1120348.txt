I disagree with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' .
I would like to putforth examples and situations I personally have experiences to support my opinion .

A person who travels alone I believe will have a lot more independency in making his own decisions rather travelling along with a tour guide .
With a tour guide we see our desicion being influenced by the guide and we get to see places the guide wants us to see rather than what we want to see .
It was in my school trip that my classmates and myself had a pretty bad exerience with the guide appointed to us .
The guide would take us to places we did n't want to see and he being a localite got us into a hotel that was quite expensive , because by doing so he would get a commission from the hotel authorities for getting them customers .
Other than that we had some other bad exeriences only because of the reason that the guide was a localite and was looking for grabbing commission wherever we went .

The best advantage in travelling alone would be that we could find out about a place by interacting with the localites or getting a copy of the local travel guide to guide us to the best places of visit .
In today 's advanced world we get to have the information of a place on our fingertips through the internet .
We also have amazing travel guide books that come in various languages and help us in getting a feel of the local culture .

I would like to end the topic on the point that I took this decision based on my personal experience and the other travel experiences that where great just because of the fact that we did n't take guide along .
