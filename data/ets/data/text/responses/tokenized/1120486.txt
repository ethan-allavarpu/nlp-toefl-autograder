I agree that successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I have three reasons to support my answer .

Firstly , taking risks is a way of finding new chances .
I think the bigger the risk is the bigger the chance you have .
And to make that chance your own you willneed hard work and that will make you a strong person .

Secondly , taking a risk and tring new things can give you new perspective and can make you have a bigger knowlege that can help you to become more successful .
For example for me to start cheerleading in my highschool was a big risk for me .
Becase I used to be very shy person and did not like to do things in front of every one else , But for me to start cheer gave me the courge to let myself out in front of the croud .
The practice are very hard and that made me a stronger person then I was before .

Thirdly , tring new things gives us an oprotunity to meet different people and know there thoughts .
and give us new prospective .

These are the reason I agree with this statement .
