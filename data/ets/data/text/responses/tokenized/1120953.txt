The issue of wether young people enjoy life more than other people meet agrate debate in the mean time .
Young people has ambition , the look to the future , the ability to get new informations about technology as life is widley opened for them to gain experiance and learn a new cultural , scientific , and social thems .
they have the health and capability to enjoy differant programs for intertanment , has the chance of getting new ferands and relationship and keeping them .
but do they have enough support or backup to help them achieve what the like to do .
foe examlpe ayoung couple may like to get along vacation from work to travel to anew country to enjoy their love and life but they have not onough money as they are in their beginig of emloyment life , morover vacations may affect their promotions , on the other hand they are responsable for other people for examlpe they have to take care of their parents or kids .
Alot of young people have shortage of intertament facilities for finnetial reasons or they have to obey other persons who is sponsoring them .
The youg are under tension and pressure of life and not had the enough experance to take over problems On otherhand older people have alot of relationships with freinds , colleagues family members as sons or grand sons who support them and take care of them , in addition to gainig of properties through life and finential independance .
but some of them might get health problems which most of them are controlable now , older couple for example can enjoy themselves with no worrey about somebody else alot of them beleive that what is going to happen let happen or let go .
so not care much about futur .

An old man once said the life is composed of three sections first thirty years of life aman has health and enjoy his jop as he has somthing to do in life but not too much resposnsbities and he has enough time to spend for leisurers and entertament but he dosenot have money to acheve his wishes .

Second thirty years aman has health , money but he had to work hard to carry on his sucesse but he dosnot have enough time .
The later life thre are the time and money but no health .

But in summary I thought i have enjoyed my life when i was young by alot of things mainly freindship , passion and love .
all with experancing of establishment of a family of our own and how happy we where , but i think We are bit older now and we feel life worth to live in and enjoy relationships , work , belongings .
