I agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they realy are .
Advertisements are there to attract customers to a certain product .
The product is always displayed in a way where it seems appeling to the viewer .
Sometimes the company advertising the product tend to exadurate in advertising .
They make the product seem to good to be real .
Each advertisement is there to target a certain age group .
For example when advertising a toy on the television certain sound effects and bright colours are used to attract young children making them desire the product .
Therefore the parents take action and buy the toy for their child .
Advertising is the best way to minpulate with young children 's minds .

Advertisements does not include the disadvantages of the product advertised .
The product is always praised and made flawless .
The company advertising a certain good main aim is profit .
Quality and customer service is the last thing considered .
It is rare that you find an advertised product that is trustworthy and is exactly like it was described on the advertisement .

In a conclusion i would like to say that the problem we are facing nowadays is that we are letting those false advertisements affect us , but there is nothing we can do about it as they are every where .
They 're displayed as bulletin boards in the streets , showed on the television as commercials and even played on the radio .
In the end were just humans and the least things affect us !!!
