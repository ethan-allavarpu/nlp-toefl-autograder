During almost 18 years , I studied many courses and I know the best way to learn .
So what I am sure about : the idea is the most important thing to understand than the facts .
I will explain this in two general parts : the first part will be about the idea that a fact is one example of the idea ; and the second one will deal with the fact that we can easier an idea than a fact .

So first , it is obvious that the idea is most important thing to understand because the facts are just some cases of the main idea .
Usually , during the classes , the teachers try to explain us an example which permits to understand the idea .
For example , to better understand the idea that people is calm when they listen music , it 's to give the example that in many medical rooms , we can hear some classical or jazz music .
But it is not the point expected to learn .
Thus , this is something we can use to better understand something else .

When we try to make our own opinion , we use the ideas memorised to think .
In this important case , we can see why it is so more important to learn the ideas than the facts .
If we continue with our previous example , what do we think about the importance of Music in the world ?
To answer , we could select the idea that Music calms people and we could use it to conclude that without Music , there will might be more Wars in the World , and so , most of the population of the Earth will be sad .
It is in this way I see the importance of the ideas .

As I proved in this response , to better learn , we have to more concentrate on the ideas than on the facts .
But the facts are needed to understand the ideas .
So , in the perfect case , we would care about ideas as well as facts .
