As our topic is about The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
i strongly agree with the note , as it has adavantages over the travelling with out a guide .
first we discuss about the travel with out guide .

As everyone interested to go to new places as per their knowledge .
they want to know the each and every thing present over there .
before going everyone will do research about that , and information we got is very little when compare when we encountered it .
sometimes it misses out good places sourrounded to that , no one is ready to explain the histroy of cultures and history of that place and also the how the importance came to that place , all these information is known to the people who staying overthere or people who visits often to the places .

Now come to the travel with guide , as they have very best of information .
now i will give my personal experince so that it elevates the advantages of travel with guide , during my college days we went to the nothern part of the india , it included few places .
when went to Tajmahal there we found very beautifull monument ever built , the guide explained the when it was built , who statrted this , and cultures followed that time , and some important things he told , after listening the lecture he made about Tajmahal , we came to know we had very little information about that .
we very much excited about the information , we really felt like we are viewing that constuction and art .
As we thought Tajmahal was the only place to visit , but the guide showed another beautiful monument just away from Tajmahal .
we dont about that before , that was also a good piece too .
After that we faced some problems regarding our trip , just lack of enough time , in that time our guide was so helpful , he planned accordingly out timings so that we not lost even single location .
As the guide was a local guy he provided good food too .
Throughout the journey we made with guide is very interesting and very helpful , after the tour we heard and learned good things like history information about the places etc .

Finally my conclusion was its not possible to know the things that really happened at the historical places , few things we can read or listen about those places but some we may not .
so taking a guide is really helpful and informative .
so that we can get more information than when we went to the travel without guide .
