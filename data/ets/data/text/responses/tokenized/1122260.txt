I think that it is a common opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In my opinion this is not so far from the real situation , but it can depends on what you mean with enjoy .
There many different aspects in this statement so I think that it is difficult to give a unique and clear opinion .

For instance , if you like play football you will not probably enjoy yourself if you are an old man .
A young boy is more powerfull and he can play for a long period of time , while an old man will probably lose his energy in few minutes , not so much time for a good and amusing match .

On the opposite , if you like to play your guitar , your age will not be a real problem .
Even if you are ten years old or seventy years old you can enjoy yourself as you want .

Maybe we can say that a young boy may have less problematic thought than an older person , so his innocence can let him the possibility of enjoying much more his life .

For example an adult man has many more things to do than his son .
He may have no free time so the young child can do anything he want to enjoy himself , while his father has a life full of problems , so he can not enjoy as his child .

There is an another aspect in this discussion that is of relevant imporatance .
Older people are often more rich than young people are .
So they can do anything they want , because they have much more money .
For example if you are a twenty years old boy and you like yacthing you may have some problem to buy one yacht .
Maybe you will buy it in your adulthood .

At the end I think that the foundamental aspect of the topic is the possibility to be sick when you became an old man .
This is a big problem and makes me think that if you are a young person you will enjoy much more your life .
