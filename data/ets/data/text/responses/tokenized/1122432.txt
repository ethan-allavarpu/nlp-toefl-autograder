I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

The first reason why I agree with this statement is that young people have changed .
In old days in Korea , young people were very helpful .
They helped to build houses and fix things , which are dangerous and hard .
This works were for young people and they did it without hesitation .
However , these days young people do not care about their communities .
Young people , nowadays , have different attitudes .

Another reason that I think is that young people are not connected with communities .
In Korea , young people , who assume as students , are very busy studying .
They go school at 7 in the morning and come back in the mid-night .
They have no time to participate for their communities .
Whereas , in old days in Korea , there were more people who were not student and also school works were not hard .

Last but not least , some young people wants to help their communities .
For example , helping and taking care of elderly people or children .
However , I am not sure about other countries , but in Korea , parents usually do not want their children , who are students , to help for their communities .
The reason is obvious that they want their children to study for their future university rather than caring about their communities .

Taking into account of all factors , people are becoming more egoistic , not only young people , but also their parents and adults .
Anyhow , we may reach the conclusion that the statement is correct .
