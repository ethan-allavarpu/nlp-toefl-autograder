Every one in this world likes to travel .
Travel teach you a new things and make you sometimes feel better .
There are a lot of people like to travel as a group .
Maybe because there are going to a new place and no one no about it , then they decide to have tour guide .
I am agree with a tour guide for three reasons .

First of all , you can find very good tourism places .
For example , if you go to any city and you do n't about it any thing if you have a tour guide , he will show every thing .
In addition , he has more experience than you because his city .
There is no tourism can know your city more than you .

Second , you will never get lost that mean you will not lose more time .
As an example , I and my friends went to Los Angles , and we do n't know anything about this ; however , we lost 3 hours looking for our hotel .
On the other hand , if we had a tour guide , we would n't lost all that time .

Third , get yourself away from dengerous places .
every huge city has dengerous places , if you do n't where are they , you will but yourself in denger .
For instance , there are many crimes these days , you have to be becarful if you to city is not your city , but if you with a group and you have a tour guide maybe is better for you .

In sammury , I suggest thet every one want to travel to have
