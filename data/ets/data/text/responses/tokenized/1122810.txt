I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

For one example , when you think about business , a company has to make new products or explore new techiniqe to make difference from other companies .
If the company can do this , it can apeal cutomer the difference of there producuts or sevices from other 's and it can profit itself monopolicaly .

For other example , when you think about a baseball team , every player shoud try new things , because we do n't need same player so much .
It makes no sence to have nine powerful hitter .
It makes nosence to have fast runner .
To consitute a strong team , the important point is the balance that can infer best outcome .
So every player have to get skill that are diferrent from other 's and new .

For last example , if you are an investor , it makes no sence to invest like others .
Iif you want to have an advantage , you hav to invest differently .
Ofcause I have to admit it is a risky action .
You may get a loss sometime .
So you have to recognize that there is a risk in investing differently from others .

From these reasons , I conclude that as long as recognizing the risk of an action , we have to try new things and teke risks .
