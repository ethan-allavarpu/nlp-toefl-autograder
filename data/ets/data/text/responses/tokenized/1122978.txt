The knowledge about the various academic subjects is good for every person because we can familier with all the subjects and we can share our ideas with all kinds of people , who came from different background .
But specialization is also good because we can go throw the deeper levels of the subject .
When I consider carefully these two , I prefer specialization in one specific subject .

First , in the specialization we can go to bottom levels of subject that means we have a chance to find out new things from important information .
This is will comes only , if we have reached the bottom levels also .
When I was in btech i found one new program about the colors in java .
I studied the entire subject in summer thats why I found the new program .
My college staff appreciated me alot .

Second , in the specialization we can findout the drawbacks about the subject thats why we can find the solutions to prevent it .
Moreover we can reduce if possible .
If see the scientists , they try to reduce the harmness to `` ozone '' layer .
They are specialists in related subjects and try to reduce harmness to `` ozone '' because they know the merits and drawbacks about the subjects .

Third , the specialist only knows the all information about the subject .
In this case I have one bitter experience that is , few monts back I met an accident to my leg .
At that time I went to one hospital , the doctor was not a specialist in bones .
He said that there is no injury to ur leg but .
