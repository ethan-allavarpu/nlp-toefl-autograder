From the newest article , I heard about the successful person who tried new things and took risks .
It talks to me about the one of good ways to succeed in our major is using our imagination for new things and trying risks .
Also , I agree this opinion , and want to talk about more detail .

First , I want to talk about new things .
When I was grown up , I heard many successful people 's stories such as Adison and Nobel .
Those people are accomplish their dream to using their imagination to try new things .
In addition , it is based on our civilization 's development because people always want to have good , interesting and convenient things , so from the invention of new things , they will buy those and satisfy .
In other words , invention of new things can get more money , and sometimes we can get a fame .
As a result , it a good ways to be a successful people .

The second reason is based on the taking risks .
Risks are dangerous in our lives .
For example , if we fail to make some good new things , we will lost all of things such as house , family and the other things .
However , if we prepare it before risks are started , we can reduce .
In addition , there are no risks about new things , we can not create new things because always new things are related some risks which is dangerous in our lives .
Although , sometimes we can figure out risks for our successful , we try to make new things .
Moreover , we have to take care of ourself , and always we have to prepare some bad situations .
For preparing the bad situation , we can reduce on the damage , when some risks are happened .

In our lives , we always demand new things than before .
Even if it can take risks to the person who try new things , it is a short way to be a successful person .
Sometimes , from overcome the bad situation , we can be important people .
For these reason , I would like to say that trying new things and taking risks help us to be a successful person .
Moreover , those behaviors make us positive and considerable people .
