Nowadays , there are many advertisements .
We also buy products as we see many advertisements .
When we see advertisements , we may feel that we must buy the products .
Some people belive most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are but others do n't believe .
Given the choose between first and second opinion , I choose the first opinion .

First , advertisements use the visual aspects .
In detail , in case of the paper advertisements or Internet advertisement , the products can seem much better in respect of color , size , shape , etc .
For example , a week ago , I ordered the clothes on the Internet site because the clothes are beautiful pink that I like .
I was so excited and expected .
Yesterday , the clothes was finally delivered but when I saw the clothes , I was quite disappointed because the clothes was ugly densed pink that I loathe .
So , following the example that visual aspect , advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Second , in case of home shopping , the cast introduce the product .
To illustrate , my aunt called my mother a few days ago , and my mother told me about the story of my aunt .
I will tell this story .
A few days ago , my aunt watched TV home shopping channel about kimchi .
The cast ate the kimchi so deliciously and said that kimchi was so yammy .
Futhermore , all guests ate kimchi so deliciously and in my aunt 's opinion , it look so delicious because of the spiced color of the kimchi and eater 's attitude .
So , my aunt ordered the kimchi but when my aunt ate the kimchi , taste is very bad and disgusting .

On top of that , most companies apply their products ' prize and prestige in the contests in advertisements so we believe and buy the products that but these may not be true .

To sum up , by above reasons and examples , I think the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
