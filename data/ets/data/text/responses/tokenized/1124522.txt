Can it be that people turns to use horess and camals again for transportation ?
I dont think soo , people over time are being better and better in discoviries , and the day will come when they start using airships and viecles that will be able to fly .
I agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the divlopment in discoviry , and the spread of air transportation .

In every new generation there are new minds and new people that thinks about life in a different way .
With all the discoviries that have been done and the new minds whicj are comin to the world they will surely discover a new way of transportation that will make cars dissappear .

Nowadays air crafts and air transportaion is the largist kind of transportation in the world , and with all this spreading in this kind of transportation and the knoledge in it are making cars a way of transportation that will not last .

therefor , i think that cars woud'nt last and there will be some other ways to move from some place to another in less time and less affort .
