Currently , the issue `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is debated by numerous educationalisties and scientist .
In my personal points of view , I prefer yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
In this essay , I will explain personal points which base on previous examples as well as specific reasons .

Firstly , Yong people spend much more time than old peole in entertainment aspect , such as TV , computer games and sports .
In one hand , yong peole is the major resouces of world entertainment industry .
Old peole trend to stay in theri world , doing theri personal hobby which not prefer to communcate with each other .
In the other hand , old people do n't have enough energy for enjoying lives due to theri age .
However , the situation of young people is totally different , the have enough energy for playing outside and enjoy theri lives .
They trend to play each other and communications .

Secondly , Yong people are much easier to accept fashion things than old peopele which are the base of enjoying lives .
For example , Young people like playing outdoor with skateboards which are the newest fashion sports in the world .
Old people can not accept this kind of sport due to security .
Therefore , old people would not access this area of sporting for enjoying theri lives .
The attitudes on new things are the majoy problems .
So , old people trend to take simple and easy traditonal games in theri lives .

In addition , most of old people prefer staying at home rather than playing outdoors .
However , yong peole choose outdoor activities as theri favourite .
In current tome , outdoor activities are the main entertainment in the world .
Thus , numerous old pelople who trend to staying at home with out outdoor activites will lose theri chances for enjoying theri lives significantly .

In conclusion , yong people like different types of entertainment and also accept more fashion things than old people .
As a result of these situations , yong peole enjoying more life than old peole .
