I agree , because the advertisement exagerate the efficiency or quality of the product sounds like a salesman in the shop .
The marketing in some many brands are aggresive that it is because , they want to compete with others and then show how are the brand is better than the others .
Example of that is the Walt Disney 's Company Over the year we saw many commercial announcements in television , internet , movies and mailing letters , they bombarding to us with this promotions over and over again but in some many ways they sellit a `` dream may come true '' but it is not true when you dedide to start a vacation in Walt Disney the do n't tell you about the long lines in the sun waiting for the attractions or waiting for eat in restaurants .
This is sort of a kind of huge mistake when the advertisement capture our attention and became more attractive that the reality .
This is an example so how the people is enchanted for some advertisement and the reality is other when arrive to `` Walt Disney '' .
Other advertisements just like food or diets show the specific people achieve their goals when entering to this plan , but the reality is other , because they never tell you how much is cost when you became interested in that program , the reality is they manipulate the statistics and sold dreams and stole money for the customers , who failed to achieve that goal .
In my opinion the people need to be more wisely when they attracted and impressed with an advertisement , just because they wants your money and not your needs or satisfaction that you want .
That why they called marketing .
