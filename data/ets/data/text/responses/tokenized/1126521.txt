I agree with the statement that says that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First , if I go back in time and I start to do some memories of my time as an students at School and at the University , all those things that I learned it was because I understood the ideas and concepts that my teachers explained to me and my classmates .
When I finally understood the process of the French Revolution I never forget it , because I did n't learned it as a fact .

Second , is really great when you get the concepts of the different things and you can start to make some interesting relations between them and with the experience of your own life .
I think that is nice when you can make questions about what you learned and give some conclutions about it .
I also found that is nice when you meet with friends and you start a conversation with them , talking and exchanging ideas of all those things that in a moment you learned and understand them .
I really have a very good time when I have those kind of opportunities to share with friends what I have learned and also to be sure that I can do my own statements .

Futhermore , I consider that Facts are too weak , you learn this facts for the test and then you erase them .
Is like a foreing learning , from one moment to onother it flyes away , from your mind .
Instead , when you really understand the ideas or concepts yo can be sure that this knowlege will never forget , never more .

Finally I can say that , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
