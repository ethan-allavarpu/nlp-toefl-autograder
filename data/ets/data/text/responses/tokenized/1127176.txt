Ethical marketing is very significant subject that should be studied in the some departments of universities .
I see lots of advertisements in television or in newspapers which describe the product as a perfect solution to customers ' problems , but , in reality it is not .
I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In all sectors , we can see these type of advertisements .
Automotive , Information Technology or Consumption sectors , no matter which sector it is .
All use advertisement ways to convince consumers to buy the product by emphasizing some points generally but not giving details about some unknown things which can influence the final decision to buy it .
To illustrate , a MP3 player usually announced in a newspaper as a product which is 1 GB and has a radio .
However , many people do not know that their radio does not work well everywhere and they even do not know how may song can be saved to that wonderfull device .
Without thinking some of them buy it while others learn the reality when they go to buy it by asking questions to the sale representative .

Another example is that some advertisement tricks are implemented in prices .
Prices are shown by excluding taxes and when you are very happy since you have found your favourite product and you go to buy it .
Usually , it is too late to change your view and thus , you buy it .

In this sense , it is certain that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are .
However , by giving more importance to marketing lectures and to their content , this unethical situation can be prevented .
Also , these lessons should be must courses instead of being elective .
