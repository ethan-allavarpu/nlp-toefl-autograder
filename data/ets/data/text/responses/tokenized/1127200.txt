Nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
i agree with that statements and i think that there are several reasons for that .

First , conditions of life has changed , everything is going faster now , people do not have much free time , they time is separated between their studies , their part time jobs , sport , and some social activities so after all this they do not have much time left to do something else .

Second , people now are no longer attached one to another as they used to be , its just like if they use the means of friendship and communication directly with others .
so as a result , if they not communicate well they will not be able to help their communities as a group .

Finally , before in a neighbourhood eveybody knows everybody because there was not much people , but now its getting crowded and they may not know who is their second neighbour .
so how would they meet and try to help their communities if they do not even know each other .

To sum up , i think that people should well organize their schedules and find some time to help their communities because after all that is where they live .
