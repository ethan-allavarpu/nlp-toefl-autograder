Everybody could tell you this : young people enjoy life whereas older people do n't .
To me , it ca n't be absolute , for several reasons .
First , we know that young people know how to have fun .
They always go out with friends , they always laugh ( most of time for nothing ) ...
Older people do n't know it .
They used to know but now they are adults and adults have a lot of responsibilities , adults always think about their work , adults always worry about everything ,,, and when they are older , they worry about death and always talk about when they were young , when they knew how to enjoy life !

We also could say that young people enjoy life because they do n't think about the future , they seize the day . .
That 's true but older people , if they like to plan everything can seize the day too .
Do n't we say that the better time of your life is when you do n't work anymore ?

What about these grandfathers and these grandmothers who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want ?
That 's why I think middle aged people are the ones who enjoy life the least .
They have too much things not to forget , too much things to do , too much things to care about . .
Young peole enjoy life because they have nothing to think about !
They go to school , go out with their friends , have complicated relationships with their boyfriends and girlfriends and that 's all . .
OK , they have to do some homeworks , but that 's not a horrible life .
They enjoy life because their life is perfect !

To finish , I would say that although they have a perfect life most of young people do n't really enjoy life .
Adolescents are always in a bad mood , they complain everytime , they always disagree with you , but what they do the best is `` to not care '' .
But older people , even if they have a quite more difficult life , know the value of life .
