Human have created these sense of going out of home called travelling .
Travelling is a very fun option for you to take .
However it is not always the way you want it to be .
On the one hand you have the opportuniy to travel in a group with a tour guide or in a group but without a tour guide .
With these in mind I personally prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide because you have the opportunity to learn more and also because you have your schedule done .

The first reason I prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide is because I can learn better the other culture .
You have a guide giving you and telling you lots of information about the new place you are visting .
For instance if you decide to travel to South Africa you would not only understand even a word but also would not learn anything about these new country completely different from yours .

The other reason I prefer travelling with a tour guide is because the schedule is already program by my tour guide .
I would not have any minute to waist time .
I would take advantage of it in every single opportunity .
In fact If you travelled without a tour guide you may not be able to wake up at seven in the morning .
A few years ago I went to Cuzco in Peru and I did not contacted a tour guide .
I did not learn anything about that incredible monument , you can not imagine how I regret it now .
It was a waste of time traveling there without a tour guide .

Therefore whether you chose to travel in a group or by yourself try to be led by a tour guide and try always to prepared your trip very carefully in order for you to enjoy it .
