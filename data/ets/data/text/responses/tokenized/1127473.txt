On the one hand I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people are more active , they can make journeys and sports .
They go to parties , spend much time with friends and have not much responsiblities .

Older people often have problems with their health .
Some older people need permanent medical and are not able to leave their home .
Furthermore they know the most of their life is over .
I think this is not an amusing thought .
So one can say many older people have not the possibilities to enjoy life , but there are also older people who do not want to enjoy life .
I know some older people who are healthy and well-off but nevertheless they do not go out , but sit in their hous and are sad .

On the other hand young people are just at the beginning of their lives and therefore they have to fight for their place in society .
This struggle is not only fun , too .
In school they have to work hard , because they want to rise their job opportunities and in university this situation is continued .
When young people have leisure time , many of them waste their time in order to play vidoe games at the computer .
Other young people are unsatisfied by society and lead life as outcasts .
In contrast to that there are many healthy older people who earn a comfortable income or are even retired .
They often afford luxurious trips and they have not so much pressure to be succesful .
Instead of stress in school , in university or at the beginning of a career , older people can play with their grandchildren or can go for a walk with other older persons .
I think this is a great perspective .

Older people can look back and see what they have achieved over the years .
That can also be great pleasure .
Resuming all that reasons , I think both young and older people can enjoy life , but I am convinced that older people more often do so .
