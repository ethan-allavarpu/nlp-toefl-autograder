I believe that is better the person specialize in one subjetc .
We need study evrything to choose this subjets , depending of as qualities .
We qualities are so differentes one to the other , but always , we have more develop in one to the other .
It is my opinion about this topics . .

For example :
I love play tennis and I practice every day , I can play with the other person and understand everything about that .
If I have a problem or the people ask me something about that , I can explain because I know about tennis .

But , if other people ask me to the soccer and he want play with me , is so different , because I 'm not play soccer and I not have practice to that sport .

If he teach me I will can play , but I 'm better to other sport .

If I want to learn to sports at the same time , I will learn but I ca n't develop all day in only one sport .
I need concentration in the two sports .

We need have different observations about different subjetc or in this cause sport before to choose any one .
Is neccesary stay sure about your decision .

Is the same with the subject 's , I can to learn the basic to each one but I need prepare in only and in my future will Know everything about my career .

If you can develop perfect the subject , now , you can find out to the other and can the same effort that the first .

Sometimes we hide many positive things , but we dont know about that , with the practice we can take off and show this hability !

we can plan our future is only our decision .
but for my life or for you life is neccesary of the study .
