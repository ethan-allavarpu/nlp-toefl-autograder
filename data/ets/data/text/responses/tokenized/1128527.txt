Some people say that nowdays young people do not have enaugh time to help their communities , that because of the rithm of our lifes we , I am 19 years old , do not have time to help poor people , to talk or to be with old people who feel alone , to make thing to help to reach the peace in some countryes or even in some families . ..

It is true that our lives have a very high rithm and that we do not have a lot of time to help our communities , but that does not mean that we do not want to do it .
Some yeras ago young people did not do lot of thngs for their communities , but the implication of the new generations in the projects of help has increased a lot during the last years .

We can see that there are more NPO 's , no profit organizations , and whose members or the people that calaborate with them do it totally free , with no maney retribution .
The objectives that these NPO 's try to reach are really different .
There are those who help poor people that do not have nothing to eat or those who help dependient drug people .
There are also some corporations that help to preserve the environement , like Greenpeace , and those who help in general kids , like UNICEF .
Others try to help woman and others try to figth against the illegal prostitution .

There are lot of organizations that try to help our communitie and that are gowing in the number of activists To sum up , I will like to say that more an more young people are helping other people , even if we do not have all the time we would like to have to do this activitie .
But young people are trying to find free time and spend it helping others , what make us more humans .
