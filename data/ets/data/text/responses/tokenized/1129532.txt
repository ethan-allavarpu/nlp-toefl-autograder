Most people think that enjoyment comes from experience , but in my opinion , when we first experience something we enjoy it more .
There is a saying that a thing is attractive untill you get it , in other words , when you wish for something and do not get it easily , you are more keen to get it .
After getting that thing , you loose your interest in it .
This is the human nature .
So the meaning is that younger people enjoy their life more than older , because they experience things for very first time .
I also agree with this opinion that young persons enjoy life more than older people .

To support my opinion , firstly , I would like to disscuss the tendency or the nature of youngers .
First of all , they are very curious about new things .
They want to explore everything regardless of danger associated with it .

For example , when I was a kid , I was always curious about parachute , and one day what happened , I just jumped from my roof top with an umbrella .
At that time I did not know , what is fear .
So meaning is that , you can not expect this kind of absurd behavior from an older person .
Even , if an old person does not know the harm associated with the task , he/she might not take risk .

Secondly , youth do not care for moral values , whereas old people do follow them strictly .
From their experience of life , senior people know the value of ethics and would like to follow always .
On the other hand , teenagers are unlikely to follow the moral values , or they follow reluctantly .

Thirdly , In my opinion , you can enjoy the life if you do n't have restriction on you activities .
Old people have resposibilities towards society , as well as towards their own family .
While youngers are free to do whatever they want .
For an instance , I like to dance publically , and I do whenever I get chance to do it .
But I know some older people can not do it because first they think about others opinion such as , what would the society think , or what would be the impact on children .

Last but not the least , young people are always open to new ideas or cultures , while older people have narrow mind .
It is easy for a younger to adapt a new culture in order to learn it .
On the other hand , senior persons are rigid to their own culture in order to preserve it .

Conclusion is that , although it is true that older people enjoy life based on their own life time experiences , I strongly hold the view that youngers enjoy the life more than them .
The main reasons are , will to explore new things , no responsibility , less regard for values or ethics , and more energy to enjoy life .
