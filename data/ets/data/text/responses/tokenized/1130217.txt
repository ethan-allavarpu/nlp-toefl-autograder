In my view , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I do not prefer to travel alone as i believe that when you travel with friends then you can take atmost pleasure and information of the travel as there will be many question for the tour guide as there will be many brains , not one .
I just want to emphasise this by using an example of my travel with my friends .

I am a history student by profession .
In the last year of my college I had a thesis to be submitted on a Great monument , Taj Mahal .
It was a tour where a group of 4 ( including me ) have gone and the place was to New Delhi , in India where Taj Mahal is located .
It is one of the ancient cities in India with great history and also the capital of the country .
There we hired a tour guide , who is believed be the best in the place .
While looking at the monument and hearing to the information from the guide , we were astonished about the history , beauty and the efforts required for its construction .
There were lot of area in the monuments whose named were not even heard by us before i.e. none of the books contained these details , which are very important for our observations and thesis .
There are lot of question that were asked by our group to the guide .
I think my share of questions would be only one tenth of the total .
Then , I realised the importance of traveling together .
I felt that if I have come to the place alone then i would have learnt only one tenth of the information for the thesis which would have reduced my scores .
After coming back from New Delhi to our place we have check our share of expenditures for the travel and it was only 40 % when compared to expenditures if one one travels else .

With the above mentioned example , I believe that travelling in group with a tour guide not only helps in getting more information about the place you visit , but also helps in reducing your expenditure for the travel .
It reinforces your relation with your friends .
You will remember and recollect your experiences and incidents in the travel through out you life .
