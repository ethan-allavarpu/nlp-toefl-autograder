I strongly believe the statement of , it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Understanding the idea is more important for every student in the class room .
the understanding the idea and concepts give the overall picture of that particular lecture .

for example in my college days i had more concentrated on my lesson , at that time i know the central idea of the topic .
This type of skills will improve the ability of study and ability of remembering .
This skills are also reducing the study time .
the students can learn more in formaton quickly .

learn facts is good but every time we dont want to study .
We dont want to sparemuch time on learn facts .
At that time these skills are very helpful .
It is very time consuming process .
understand ides and concepts will helpful any time .
for example i want to go to exam , first i will go to through the topic then understand the main idea of that topic and concept of that one .
I regularly follow this rule of studying .
So in this way i get more information with in time , i save my time also .
In this way os studying igot good marks in my exams .

For example we will go one reading passage first of all we skim the passage then get the main idea of the passage .
this time the reading is easy otherwise it will tough .
In this way of getting ideas studens get lot of exposure , the thinking ability will also increase .
In this way learning facts is difficult to rembering with idea of the topic .
So i strongly believe this statement , it will helpful alot in education and futere aspects .
