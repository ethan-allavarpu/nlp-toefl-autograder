In our society students were confronted with new knowledge in school , but the question of whether or not it is more important for them to unterstand ideas and cencepts instead of learning the facts it is another matter .

From my point of view it is very difficult to take side over the other in these argumentation because it seems to me that there are both advantages and also disadvantages .

In the following passage I will make my point of view clear .

On the on hand , I think that it is in same subjects important to unterstand the idea and the concepts .
In this context I can mention my own experience in my school time .
I realized and unterstood Mathe just because I really learnt the different ways which I could choose to come to a solution .
It was sometimes definitely hard to unterstand .
However , it leads to a deeper unterstanding in this area .
Another argument I can mention in this context is the history class i attended .
History contributes so many facts of the past which are not essential to become an educated student .

While there are positiv aspects for becoming aware of a good unterstanding of ideas , I feel that it is in some subjects not necessary to unterstand the whole background of the subject .
Sport for instance is a very theoretic lesson and the history is not important .

Consequently , my argumentation makes clear that it depends on the topic if a teacher really should confront their students with all the information which are available or if he better focus just on the important and significant ones .
