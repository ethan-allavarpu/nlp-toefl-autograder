I absolutely agree whit the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their comunities because they have other worries in life and do not have more time to be involved with their community .

Nowadays young people has many other worries and does not have time to spend for their community .
This problems are that some youngers while are studying they have to work in order to pay their studies .
Other youngers have problems with money and as nowadays life is very expensive they have to work so many hours in order to go on with everything .
And if we talk about youngers that have already children , it is not viable .
For instance , I am 27 years old and I finished my degree and now I would like to do a postgraduated program overseas in order to improve my professional skills and knowledges .
In order to do that now I have to spend most of my time working so many hours so I will be able to carry on with my studies .
Not only I have to worry for my studies but for my flat , the bills , the rent .
And in a few years I would like to have a child .
Eventhough this pitty situation I would really like to have a little of time helping my cummunity but since the rythm of life goes so fast I think that it is impossible at least at the moment .

As life goes so fast in my opinion I understand that young people nowadays have so many problems to spend helping their communities .
Maybe if the rythm changes things will go better and
