Young people tend to do alot of activities and can perform alot of taskes and desires .
In contrast to older people who can have difficulties to having their wishes and desires fulfilled .
that is why , young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Physically speacking , older people walked most of the roads in a life time , they are more weary and exhusted from thier trip .
Minimal interest in trying new things is obvious on an elderly person .
Contradicting young people who have the energy and stamina to preforme taskes , ambition and the lure of the exsotic takes over their minds , trying everything and tasting life in all of its colours , dicovering , learning , felling and performing more missions every day , every moment .

Emotions do have a big effect on a human being .
Old people understand that they aged , they know for a fact that their mission in life in almost over , some are sensitive about death and they dont want to loose their families and friends .
But , younger people view life as a long trip , a horrizon of advantages they should grasp to sucseed .
They have all their life to look forward to .

The metal condition is huge wall to older people .
They gradually start to lose their ability to think clearly and remember information , which is a big hussel to them , they know that thier organic computer ( brain ) in starting to disintegrate and deminish but they cant do anything about it .
While young people are at their climax of intelligence , new ideas , new information to invent and learn and a future to look forward to .
so why should a young person worry about his mental status ?

At the end , young humans are more lively and happy in their lifes , and old people tend to be more sorrow and sad about their current situation .
So stay young and happy if you can .
