I believe that is treue that the young people do not give enough time to helping their comunities but this is caused for the society and the parents .

I am a young girl and I am totally agree with this statement .
In my opinion the youngers are busy in their own things and don-t worry of the troubles that appear in their own comunity .
They and I think that there are people that worry of the things of the society yet and they will look for some solution .

The youngers that have a good life are the less worried because their parents help them and will solve their problems and they don-t think that when they will be adults won-t stay their parents .

I know that this position is worse but this is that our parents teach our .
Some exemples are when we throw some paper at floor and we aren-t be able to take the paper and put in the rubbish .
Or when somebody paint with a spray on the doors . ..
This persons don-t think when they do that , they do that they like .

I wish that the youngers were more careful and that they think before to do anything .
They have to know that whole the worse of the society is bad for they .
I like that the politics would do more programes for the young people because this would help to envelope on the troubles of the society .

And believe that with the help of the whole our own comunity will became to be better !
