The statements of quality of products is a complex and controversial issue .
While some people argue that advertisments do n't give the real quality of product , other people think that they know what they buy .
So , advertisements can not influenced their choice .

Both perspectives are importants , but overall , I desagree with the statement that advertising influences my choice .

My point of view is important because we overall know the differents products we use for ourselves .
As an example , when you want to buy a car , you use specifics informations about the type of car you want and do n't follow necessarily advertising provide by any car company .

Secondly , advertisements are not firstly directed to influence the choice of custommers .
It is highly used by company for settle their leadership ( best selling ) .
This can be illustrated by the fact that when someone want a specific car , he has the choice between sometimes more than one company .

Some people can object that , young boy are mostly influence by advertising .
This objection can be countered by the fact that they are not responsible for their purchases .
When they want something , they ask their parents to buy it for them .
And overall , the parents do n't follow thre desire of their children because they know what is important for them or not .

While the issue of quality of products must be considered carefully , the fact that we know what we want compoumded with the object of the company to settle at a leadership place produce convincing why I desagree whith the following statemement : ** Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are **
