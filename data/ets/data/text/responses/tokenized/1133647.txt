I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
As a matter of fact , people who are open-minded , manage their time well and work hard , regardless of old or young , can enjoy their life without questions .

A bright and vigrous young spirits may have more curioisties than older people to explore the world .
They are bound to learn any information they are enthusiastic with .
They may have lots of social activities they have to participate in such as parties , concerts and sports and make friends .
However , a young people who grew up in a dysfuncitonal families with narrow-minded , may not have moods to learn and play .
They may fall in the depression and hateful environments and kill time by doping drugs or hook around .
They drop out from schools and do not know what to do .
They do not know how to manage themselves and their time as well , so there 's no good life they can enjoy .

On the other hand , a great deal of vivid older people may retire from their jobs and they are veterans who save pensions and good at how to lead a beautiful life .
They manage their time carefully .
They may get up in the morning to take a walk at the park , read newspaper on the bench and enjoy sunshine , arrange a nice trip and visit old friends sometimes ; cultivate hobbies to make their child 's dream come true .
Some older people who do not manage well from their youth may suffer financilly difficulty to organize their life .
They are sick and can not go anywhere .
Illness brings hard and unhappiness life for them .

Therefore , no matter young and old , people can enjoy life easily if they appreciate how precious life are and manage their times well and keep open-minded .
