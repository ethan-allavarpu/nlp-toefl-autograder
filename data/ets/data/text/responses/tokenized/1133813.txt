In this essay I 'll discuss if I agree or disagree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
First of all , I want to say that I do n't agree completely with this statement because is too semplicistic say that young people now do not give enough time to helping their communities .

In fact , for sure , there are a lot of young people nowadays who think only about theirselves and do n't spend time for helping their communities but , on the contrary , there are a lot of young people involved in social activities .

In fact , I knew a lot of young people everyday involved in some different activities to helping their communities above all young people part of specific groups .
For example , they help children with family problems to do their homework after the school , they play guitar during church celebration on sunday and when I was younger and I attented the secondary school , in particular , I also did a lot of these kind of activities but unfortunately now I do n't have enough time to do these and so I try to do something else .

As a lot of young people in fact , I 'm part of the red cross and for this reason twice a year I go the hospital and I give for free my blood to help a lot of people who everyday need blood due to some different problems .

In conclusion , I can say that I agree with the fact that there are a lot of people nowaday that do not give enought time to helping their communities but I want underline instead , that there are a lot of young people very sensible , acting in social activies and for these reasons that spend a lot of thei time for helping the others .
