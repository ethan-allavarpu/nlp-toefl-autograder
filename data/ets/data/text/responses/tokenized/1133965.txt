It is absolutely true that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they reallly are .
But how this happens ?
That is not an easy is question to answer , but I think this is also the only question to make in order to understand why advertisements have this particular effect .

I believe that the main strategy used by market analysts is simply to influence people by touching their weaknesses .
Everyone of us for example , or at least most of us , wants to be accepted by society ( our group of friends or our collegues ) .
It is un unconscious process but it is like that , and we can do nothing against it .
As a consequence of this process we tend to buy the products that we feel could change in a better way the conception that the other have of us ; any object that could improve of our social image is certainly to be bought .

I will try to make an example .
If I know that David Beckam shaves with a particular aftershave I might think that by using that specific product I will achieve the same social approval he has .

That is why most advertisements use famous people to sponsorize a product : because we unconsciously want to be like them .
Any way , the question is whether there is a solution to this kind of problem , it is in fact a problem the one we are talking about , because linked to a weakness of modern social communities .

I simply think that , considered that we can not change the entire costumes of our society , the starting point is being aware of this fact .
This way of reasoning will make us more critics on advertisments , whose products will seem no more as attractive as we thought they were before .
