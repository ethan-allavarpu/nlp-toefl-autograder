The discussion about the success of people according to the risk level of their doings should be splitted into two parts .
One the one hand are people , which try new things and take risks to fullfil their target .
On the other hand are people , which do what they already know to do well .

Such two different types how to handle with risk will reach the final success .
People have different kinds of meanings about their own apility of risk .
If I think about such difference , I will talk about two friends of mine .
The one boy is about 35 years old .
He reached one of the best school examination with a grade of 1.2 during his school periode .
He began studying law and finished university after less than the regular studing time of 4 years with a very good grade .
His first contact with the economic or in gereral with business had taken place for him with 26 years in a big company as an assistante for law specific questions for consoulting contracts .
He was very resistent against risk , maybe because of his first contact with the business world .
He had been in such office and position for almost 9 years without a lot of experiences , but also without trying any higher risk , than going home early then 10 minutes before the regular business closing time .

My second example is a boy , who is 28 years old .
He finished school with a grad around 2.5 , which hab been the middlefield in his final examination year .
He started an own business idea after his examination .
His business was about the offering of IT solutions for small and middle sized companies .
In the time of the new market economy a lot of companies used the consoulting work of his company .
He had have a lot of fixed costumers , which needed his help regularly .
During such periode he had have the idea to export the concept to other countries , which he started in 1999 with Austria .

Banks helped him to fullfil such target by offering a lot of money .
After two years he had have 4 office outside Germany and a sum of 4.500.000 Euros as a negative deposit on the bank .

The concept failed by the crash of the new market and he lost all the life standart almost in 2 month and will not be able to pay the whole deposit to the bank in his life time .

As a conclusion of my two examples , the level of risk can not be argued by the level of school education , meaning the final examination grade , and the university status .

Moreover people with a ability to try risks , will have a faster success and will be stay there , if they control themselves regularly .
The risk of falling down , because of uncontrolled mistakes is more realistic in comparision to the risk resident people .

However , every human beeing have to know for themselves which goals and objectives he or she wants to reach and how fast to get there .
In adition such factors will bring the level of risk ability and the success .
