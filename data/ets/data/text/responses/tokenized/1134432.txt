having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects seems more interesting than specializing in only one subject , however , we ought to determine all the advantages and inconvenients to make our mind ,

I am convinced about the great importance of mastering at least several subjects in order to increase our general knowledges , It seems nowadays indispensable to be aware of a lot of subjects that belong to varied for example , we are to be able to talk about politics , ecology , communication and business , and this would not be possible if we did not get broad knowledge in history , biology or mathematics , If not , we will not feel concerned about very important subjects that are part of our life , That the reason why we need to accumulate a lot of knowledge while we are still in college ,

After being part of this learning process , and only after that , you will be able to choose one specific subject that corresponds truly to your personality , your skills and your motivation .
Then , you might be further in the subject you have chosen to express yourself in the best way , Whether if you were previously not interested in other general subjects , I am afraid that it would be difficult to envision things in a very mature and complete way ,

to conclude , you should have a look around you to be open6minded whatever your speciality may be in order to be able to use a wide range of skills ,
