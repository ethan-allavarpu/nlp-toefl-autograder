I agree in parts with the statement that the `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
The statement stated by the author seems to be correct at some situation and proves to be wrong at other situations making this statement as debatable .
I will give some example to prove my point in this essay .

The statement of author mentions `` enjoyment of life '' .
This term is very relative in respect of peoples .
Every person try to live his life colourfully in his own way .
If enjoy means partying then it may be possible that young people are doing more frequently than older people but when it comes to celebrate then older people are not step back from the younger generations .

I do agree sometimes because younger generations are having better and suitable conditions for the time to enjoy .
Young peoples are enthusiastic , active and having energy to enjoy the sports events by playing and cheering , they are very eager to explore the new places .
Young People having interests for movie go for it whenever they get time , They go for picnic to have a change and the thing that generally many young people enjoy that is to dance continuously for hours .
They enjoy various foods of different taste at many of the times .
This can be termed as enjoyment .

If we accept the author statement then it would be like that older peoples are not enjoying but carrying thier life ahead only .
The things which are done by younger generation are being done by older generation earlier and thus they lost the charm in those things and they are not having enough strength to do the same thing continously .
But they are enjoying in different manner , sitting on a chair taking sunbath , Reading newspaper and giving advices to younger generations .
They are not able to taste various foods because of their physical conditions but even taking that food by hiding from other people .
They are the leader of the house , they are having certain responsibilities to be taken care of .
This can also be termed as enjoyment but of some different kind .

In Sum we can say this point is quite debatable and needs to do sampling of people and other techniques to reach some conclusion .
