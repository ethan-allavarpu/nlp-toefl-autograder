Although some people like to learn things that they want to use in their real life , i like to spend more time on the theories and i want others do the same thing as well .
There are several reasons : to advance our world , to contribute for a better fututre and to satisfy our needs .

Many people think that human beings improved their life a lot and they are the ruler of the planet , earth , i disagree .
For example , a century ago , we even did not have electricity .
What scholars did was to develop theories and to care about science .
For instance , if we did not have Einstein or Edison or other scholars , there would not have been electricity or new discoveries .
We may have been countinued our life with primary machines and in dark houses .

Moreover , we have tremendous problems in our world .
Even though we have computers , rockets and flying cars , the end of the world may too close .
For example , the global warming contains a big threat and we need to save our world .
How can we solve this problem ?
Most likely by thinking more about science ( theories ) , we probabely will solve the problem .
In fact , we need more scientists to pay attention to this area and we need to encourage new generations to take science courses and think more about theories .

We do not have plenty of foods and resources and we need to improve them more .
Without spending energy on the theories behind the genetically modified foods , it would be imposible to grow healthier and numerous foods .
For example , I used to pay two dollars for a pound of apples containing a lot of diseases , now i pay less for better apples .

Summing up , without spending more time on the theories , we could not improve our life standarts and i appriciate to the all scientists devoided their time on them .
