I agree to the statement that ' the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' .
The best reason to put forth is of the knowledge the guide has because he has been to the place earlier and knows a lot many things about the place .
If I were to plan a trip with my friends the first thing to do would be to hire a guide .

Many reasons can be put forth for choosing a guide to help us through the trip , primary reason being his knowledge of local places .
If I were to book a hotel I would n't know the pricing and also to get to places , hiring a transport could be a big problem .
The guide comes in handy for he knows the most economical places to stay in and also these days we see guides getting into contracts with local drivers to help travellers have the option having their own transport to see the various places of visit .
I have recently come across a travel arrangement company that has their own dedicated staff as a guide for helping the travellers have a memorable experience .

The guides being local to the place have a good knowledge of the local places of visit and would help us getting a good feel of the local culture by showing us the places that show the true local culture .
Even there are places of eating where we can see the real taste of the place .
These can be only be visited if have a person guiding us to these places .
Often a guide is like a local friend helping us in staying at the best hotels at an economlical price , eating the best food , visiting the best places .

I would like to end the topic by stating that the guide is the best person who can make our visit exciting and helping us out in planning the trip with only a little monetary cost .
