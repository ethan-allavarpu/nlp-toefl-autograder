In my opinion , I agree with the statement that it is the best way to travel in a group which led by a tour guide .
And my reason is basic on following reasons .

Firstly , traveling with a tour group is safer than traveling alone , being taken by a tour guide , you can go to anywhere which have security garentee , otherwise , it is dangerous for you to go to a strange city without someone taking you .

Secondly , a tour guide can tell you were to go and what to see , obviously , they know better than we do , being taken by a tour guide , you can make your trip worth , and you wo n't wast your money which you spend on this trip .

Thirdly , if you go to a foreign country where the people speak foreign language that you ca n't understand , it will be very difficult for you to communicate with others when you want to buy someting or ask fordirections , in that case you need a tour guide to help you .

In conclution , it is better for us to have a tour guide and travel in group , because it 's safer , and you can receive more help .
