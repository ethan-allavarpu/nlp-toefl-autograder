There different attitudes toward taking tirp .
Some people prefer to act individually and take trip by their own or by a coupl of close friends .
On the other hand some people are defenders of tour packeges and rely on tour guides .
I personally think , taking trip specially for strange and unknown places needs a grest deal of information about such regions .

First of all , there many unpreditable conditions which at first may seem so interesting whle practically it could turn into an unwanted disaster .
For instance consider you want to go to a place which have hered alot about its breathtaking and spectaculatr view .
You are tempted to take trip and visit that region .
While trekking you feel that you are attached to earth and could not move .
Suddenly you know that you are in the marshland .
In such situation there is no remedy while you could visit there by a group .

Furhtermere , in a group most of people could take more responsibality and all work are done more organised in comparison with individual actions .
By sharing different responsibilty and tasks no person will feel exhuasted and consequantle the journey will be more enjoyable for all .
For instace in a climbing one could prepare the food or one could carry the stuff .

Moreover , generally speaking group collaborative actions increse individual 's sense of responibity and consequenty from scial aspect these people could become a good team player and in other soicial action they couldact ecffectively .

To sum up there are many vitues in group travels .
Firstly , decreasing the possibility of occuring some dangerous and unpredictable events .
In addithin sharing resposiblities among group member wil make travelers relaxed .
Finall being in groups stimulates people 's sense of responsibilty for other social actions in future .
