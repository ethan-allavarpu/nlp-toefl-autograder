I absolutely agree with the statement that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for then to learn facts .
The only informations from school that never left a person 's mind is the datas that he understood clearly .
About 14 years after I graduated from university , it is interresting and curious to see how I can explain most of my knowlegde to my son .
Most of those information were very well understood not just memorized .

After a couple years , even if a person have a good memory , he wo n't keep in mind the concept and knowlegde that he never understands .
I learned when I was a child a lot of verses on the bible , because my kid 's school had learned me those verses .
But now , because I do not repeat then all the time , I forgot a lot of then .
I di n't care to understand them , just learn then to have good grade .
But now , now all I can remember are verses that they explained to me and those wich have a importance in my life .

I think education today should focus more on explain things insteed of just let student learn then .
Our world will be better .
