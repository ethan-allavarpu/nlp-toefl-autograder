yeah i totally agree with this statement because what is allowing the car to turn on is the gas and the gas is getting more and more expensive because of the decrease of the worldwide gas ressources due to overexploitation .

everybody know thinking about how we are going to substitute gas , some solutions are there but they are to expensive butwhen we will find an appropriate and non polluant fuel it will come out with new automotives it will be a revolution .

nowadays cars rejects too much carbon into the atmosphere and it s very bad for our planet , cars pollute too much and we can t keep on pollutinglike nothing will happen , people will realise how bad is they cars for the atmosphere end everybody will prefer to have a bike or a non polluant automotive vehicle .

the technology allows us to build these kind of cars but the reason why the cars builders ain t generalizing this kind of cars is because now the governements and people don t really see how fast carbon damage our planet but if we keep on polluting wiyth our cars like ther s no consequences in something like 10 years the effects will be more violent and will happen more frequently and that will make everybody want to stop polluting before it s too late .

cars are being banned everywhere in the world . ..
for example in paris the mayor closed many of the city roads to the cars and opened it to the buses in oder to force people to take public transportation and let them cars home , in mexico city it s worst because there you can use your car only once in the week , the government did that to decrease air pollutiobn because mexico is one of the most polluted city in the whole world .

cars are too much polluting and it s going to get more and more expensive just to put gas in it so in the next years i m sure you will see new kinds of automotive
