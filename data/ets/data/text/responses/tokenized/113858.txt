SUCCESFUL PERSON
I agree that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because they have creative , not hesitate personality , adn they do n't afraid .

People who try unique things and take risks can be creative because they are openmind and old things which are known are not enough for them , they are hungry new things .
For example , in my country which still has been developing , a person started to sell a new kind mp3 player and he spent considerably huge money .
While he was doing this , he took a risk because while he was doing it , there were many mp3 player and generally people do not want change their habbitant in my country .
But he did not care it and he entered the almost evfery shops and people have started to buy this new kind of mp3 player and it has been common .

However people who take risks do not hesitate because they have challenging personality .
Do a person hesitate while make a decision , he can not be succesful .
Succesful person can make their decisions in every cicumstance .
For example , my friend has a shop and it is almost 25 years old .
There were a problem about economy in my country and many shop owners closed their shops because they could not stood agains it .
Even though my friend suffered from it , he did not closed because he made some important decisions in this cicumstance , and he did not hesitate .
Now , he is working in same place .

Also succesful people do not afraid from anything such try to do new thing .
Some owners afraid from doing new thing , they think that if I can not sell it , I will lose my company .
Even they who are company owner think like this , if they did it , they would earn more money and they would be big .

In conclusion one who take risks and do unexample thing , he or she will be succesful .
