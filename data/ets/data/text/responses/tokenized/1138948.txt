The density of cars in the world is increasing dramatically each year .
As far as I know , there are no reasons to think that this tendency is going to change in the next twenty years .
Specially , if we have in consideration different factors such as : the economic growth of countries like China or India that will allow its population to buy more cars , the general reduction of car prices ( specially due to competition existing betwen american and asian manufacturers ) or the quality of the existing cars ( that will allow its use during a longer period ) .
Finally , we ca n't ignore the fact that more infrastructures are being built all around the world in order to absorve the expected increase of the number of cars .

Althoug it is true that the number cars existing in western markests will increase softly , the BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) are undeveloped markets , where the number of cars will increase dramatically .

On the other hand , prices of the cars are being reduced because of the tremendous effort done by American and Asian producers in order to lead the world market .

All the above supported by the effort done by all the governments on building new and faster higways .

In conclusion , for the above mentioned reasons , the number of cars existing in the world will be increase in the next generations , despite environmental an oil problems .

it uilt in order to absorve an important increase in the number of cars provide better hicars will be safer , more economic and more population
