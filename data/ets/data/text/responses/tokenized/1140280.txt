Students meet many kinds of information in their courses or lectures .
It can be regarded as an information overload on students .
The lectures usually include ideas , concepts and facts which students should learn and use .
I assert that students should try to understand ideas and concepts instead of facts in the lessons in order to be successful .
Understanding of ideas and concepts rather than facts offers knowledge which is more lasting and provides students with deep and total understanding of topics .

First of all , a students has two choices , when he or she is studying on a lesson ; memorizing the facts which are included in the subject or understanding the main concepts and ideas which are covered in the subject .
If he or she prefers memorizing to understanding , his or her knowledge will be lost after some days later .
Because of the reason , covering the ideas and concepts is more useful and helpful than learning the facts .

The other important advantageous of understanding ideas and concepts is deep and total understing of the subject .
The ideas and concepts have more meaning than facts .
In other words , they are more valuable in terms of the meaning .
On the other hand , facts may be just case or specific situation .
It is narrow and has generally meaning about itself .
It seems that ideas and concepts should taken interests than facts by the students .

To conclude , it is the students ' preferences whether he or she pays more attention on ideas and concepts in the subject or not .
The other choice is memorizing facts in the subjects .
Understanding ideas and concepts is more lasting and provides students with deep and total understanding .
After considering the two advantageous of ideas and concepts , which mentioned before , they are enough to prove its importance .
