I agree with the fact that it is important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
Ideas and concepts are two essential factors for learning .
Ideas are the way by which one would learn about something by his past knowledge , by his past experience or by your imagination .
Concepts are the one that provide you the with the fundamentals of learning things .

Take an example of car and an aircraft .
Both are different objects for tranportation .
The idea behind developing them was to develop different means of tranportation fulfilling the different needs of human .
The basic concepts involved in developing them are the different laws of motion , pure sciences .
The fact is that a car is used for transport on land whereas an aircraft is used as means of tranport in air .
It is important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts first .
The facts can be learnt once you are proficient with the ideas and concepts .
If they only know the facts and not the concept , their learning would be limited .
If they continue to learn things this way ( by knowing facts ) , they would not be able to apply knowledge of their learning .
Emphasing further , it would be important for the students to learn the ideas and concepts first which when combined would give rise to facts .
Thus a student if learnt the basic idea and concept of laws of motion could automatically understand the facts involved with that .

Ideas and concepts , facts are different ways of learning things .
But ideas and concepts are the foundation pillars of your knowledge .
Your building ( knowledge ) strength lies in your foundation and not on our asthetic view ( in this case the facts learning ) which just gives a shallow knowledge about the strength of your building founadtion .
