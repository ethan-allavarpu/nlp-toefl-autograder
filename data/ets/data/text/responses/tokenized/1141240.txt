I agree with the statement , it is a need to take risks in life to be successful , if you stay in your confort zone you will never improve and grow to become a successful person .

We are all born with no knolege , we do n't event know how to walk , that is one of thefirst chalenges we face in life , to lear a new thing .
If we were to start life staying safe and not exploring we would not even know how to walk .

Later in life we have to push our selfs to go to school and become part of a class , and keep trying new things like reading writing , improving and getting smarter .

By the time we take that first job we have already done alot of things out of that confort zone , new things , and there is people that in that point of there life are confortable with were they are .

In my oppinion you have to keep going .
Trying to inovate , change and grow , learning new skills that can make you successfull in what you really want to do .
Becoming seccessful means something different for every body , to me a successful person is one that knows what is looking to get from life , and is not afraid to try new thing in order to do what make Them happy .
I thing everybody shoul take the risk of doing new thing in order to become Succesful and happy people .

The last time a took risks doing something a did not know how to do well was learning to surf .
Now is one of the things I like the best in my life and i can not picture my self living in California not doing surf .
Taking risk pays off .
