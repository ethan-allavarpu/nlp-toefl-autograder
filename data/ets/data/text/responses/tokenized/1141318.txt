I disagree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I think the best way to travel is alone or with a freind .
There are two reasons .
First , it 's more free .
Second , bagpack is more exciting .

The first reason is that I have much more free time than in a group .
Th be specific , I can go wherever I want and spend a lot of time in some place without any resistant .
If I want to go shopping , I do not care other people .
So I can go small shop and see aroud where I intersting .
That means I have freedom in a trip .

Second ting , It is more exciting .
For example , when I vistied Italy last years , I stayed youth-hostel .
In there , I made friends who came other country .
So , we went popular spaces , restaurant , park and river together .
Until now , I contect her by email .
Even if I had not plan go concert in Italy , I saw the pamplet and went there .
I can not forget that concert .

That 's why I think best way to trevel is alone or just with a friend .
