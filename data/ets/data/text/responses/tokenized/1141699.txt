I somewhat disagree with the statement because I believe that although it may be important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , it is more effective for your future career if you specialize in one specific subject .

For example , in school I learned about many subjects including science , mathematics , drama , music , history , photography , ethic , etc. , which served me as basic knowledge for my day to day live .
After I graduated I decided to study marketing , and I made a bachelor in business administration with a concentration in marketing .
Therefore I had to take finance and accounting clases , additional to the marketing concentration clases .
I was n't as happy with the accounting and finance clases , as I was with the marketing clases , but I believe that it is imortant for me to have at least a general knowledge of other related subjects .
This two courses served me as a supporting base for what I learned in marketing because it 's related .
And `` related '' is the clue word here .
I do n't find its necessary for me to study a little bit of medicine , architecture and politics in the university , just to have a broad knowledge in many subjects .
For me it 's more important to concentrate in subjects related to my major if that 's where I want to work in my future .
That 's why I 'm planning to do now a master degree , to even concentrate more and learn more in the studied before .

Therefore , I conclude that learning about other subjects it 's usefull for your day to day live and general knowledge , but as you get older I believe you should concentrate more in the subject you want to work with .
Specializing in one specific subject makes you a `` pro '' in it , and It is better to be a `` pro '' in a subject than to be a `` mediocre '' in many subjects .
