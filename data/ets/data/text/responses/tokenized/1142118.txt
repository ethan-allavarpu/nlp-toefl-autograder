In many situations , as human beings , people are often caged or trapped in a knowledge-cage and only some exceptions will occour once in a while .
Not saying that knowing alot is a bad idea but , specializing in a perticular area is the step of leaving your name in a history book .
The depth of which a perticular area of knowledge is explored is far more beneifitual than having a broad knowledge of every academic subjects .
Therefore , i strongly disagree with the statement , since that only guides you more into a --- normal person .

From not only historical evidences but also personal experiences , specialized in a certain area of knowledge would surely make you speical from all the rest , not only so , it is the best way of leading to sucess in future life .

To begin with , a famous biologist english plant scientists has made the most remarkable achievement to the area of biology .
But , when you ask what he differs from the rest of the biologist scientists ?
is becuase of his consistancy and specialized work in the observation of pea plants ; he studied the same plants for over 20 years and thus , finally he got a Nobel prize for he achieverments .
Not only , he will be remembered but his work of investment and achievement to the grounds of genetic coding will also do great benefits to the rest of the society .

This , made her work still popular and is now what many modern poets are looking to achieve and trying to copy her style .

Lastly , Not only people that are in the academic area are famous but also , one of the most famous person which most people would know is , `` The Great Michael Jordan '' he is known for his basketball skills .
howeevr , many do not know that even though he may seem to be the best basketball player in that time , it was once said by his college professor and his college coach that , `` It seem like basketball and Michael has a strong bond , he seem to only know how to play good basketball '' and sure , the world has prove him right , he had won himself billions and billions of dollors and fame , just simply by doing playing good basketball .

In conclusion , from these examples , we can clearly see that be spcializing in a specic area would not only make one famous but also , it would sure leave ones name in the history book .
By this , i strongly disagree with the p
