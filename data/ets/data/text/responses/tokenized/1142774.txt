This is a really common theme for these periods .
Young people most of the time are not interested to help and to develop the community in which they live .
Just a small part of them is really interested at the topic .
Often this new generation is selfish and it is worried to satisfy their needs instead to open their mind to the community .
I can say that many things are changed during these years , in the past the people s commitment was much more developed and felled compared to these days .
My parents , my grandparents really believed in the possibility to create a better place to live , moreover they tried with a lot of efforts to improve activities that could let the community be a better place .
There were the trust that something could change if you are really interested in what is around you .

Nowadays i think that the reponsability to take care of the community is disappeared at all - young people think that is not their problems being worried about the community enhacement , thus the common believe is that just the governament has to promote and support it .
Furthermore the young people are not interested in this aim because there is not for them a clear return in terms of money or materialistic benefits .
This generation has lost the beuty in believing on the power of the ideas .
They do not fight anymore for an idea but just for themselves .

An example of the difference between the past and the current days could be provided by a short story told me by my granfather In the 1940 my grandfather was very interested to the problem of our town .
He was a person that has tried to improve the economical condition of our city and to develop the spirit for the community .
In that period in my small city thre were not a cinema .
The citizens of that time complained most of the time for this kind of lack , even because in that period the cinema was something new and it appealed most of the people .
My grandfather was the one who invested money and finally bought the first cinema odf my town .
Everbody can remember him firstly as a good person a then as someone who did at least some efforts to take care of the community .
