The most important time

Nowadays , most of young people do not have enough time to have their own time .
Some students can not have time for their own work or rest as their parents does not allowed or they have really busy schedule for study .
So I think young people does not have enough time to help their communities .
Now I want to talk about the time as they have and the reason why I think young people do not have time .

I have seen many students who spend hard time to study their school work and keep their busy schedules .
I think the students have to have enough time to help their communities .
It is because during they are helping their communities , they can get lots of life experiences which give them more important knowledge than the study in their school .
Some times life experiences bring really important things to people to know for their life .
Also the communities are important just like life experience .
They will get many thing which they want to know , when they are talking or chetting with others and friends .
For example , if we study with others , we can get much imformations which very useful than studying by our selves .
Nowadays , our life is changing and people can not get their own time anymore .
Also young people are busy to live in these days and it is same happening to students .

In my opinion , if we have free time to communicate with people and have some rest time , even if we have busy schedule , it will bring better conditions and results to them .
I believe that if they have time to help their communications , they will get clear idea to study more effectively with better conditions .
