Over time , marketing and advertising strategies have being changed and improved in order to attract more and more the attention of the public .
One way to this is creating advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are , which I trully believe for several reasons .

First of all , I had a personal experience where a I bought a lotion that promised to make a person loose certain amount of inches in the waist line .
The actual advertisement showed the typical before and after picture .
After using the product for a while , and even finishing it all , nothing happened .
I did n't loose any inches , in fact .
And these

Second , some companies make the product look better by simply omitting some information or having it appear on the advertisement in small letters .
This information , is in some cases crucial such as side effects , contraindications , among other .

On the other hand , if companies advertisement strategies do not maximize the benefits of the products , wo n't be able to compete successfully with other products in the market and therefore wo n't be able to mantain a position the economy .

In conclusion , most companies nowadays have to make their products look really efficient , oherwise people wo n't buy what they do n't believe will work properly or wo n't meet their needs .
