In my opinion i disagree with the topic about most advertisements make products seem much better than really they are .
In this new global world and era the companies try to reach so many people around world by the use of technology .
But it can be sometimes harmful for the consumers who do not pay attention .

Firsty of all there are too many ways to attract consumers about the product .
We can use internet , tv , radios , by giving advertisements .
All of them are effective .
by using a famous footballer or model you can increase the popularity of the product .
On the other hand , the companies use cameras and light illusions to show the product more attractive .
Also this method can be used for showing the big one as a little and the slow one as a huge one .
An addition to this mechanisms the advertisment given on tvs or internet are repeated so many times in order to persuade and convice the consumers .
this made pressure on the consumers to try the product .
the last factor for me to attract the consumers about the product is its price .
As we know if a product is cheap we always think that it is the best suitable one for us .
It i a quite wrong stetement in fact .
Thus the companies know this situation and use it as a most well known weapon .

In spite of the stated facts below , there are also some advertisement reclects the obvious and fair appearance and usage of a product .
In such kind of situation we can try to companies mark on it .
For example some marks like bmw , general electrics , lcw are most well known producers so we can trust their product also advirtisements .

Consequently , in our global and technologic world all companies try to take a role in world trade and make much more money .
Furthermore we can say thet worlds management is related with some big companies .
So the smaller ones try to be in this huge budget .
And also they can do everything to get this even they force the countries to begin a war .
Attractive products to convince people are an easy piece of cake for them .
