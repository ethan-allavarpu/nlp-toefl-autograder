I agree with the statement .
I think people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Here is an example why I agree with the statement .
I know a person who became rich man .
Actually , he is my grandfather , and died in peace .
When he was young , he was good student .
He never thought about making money .
He just liked to study everything he wanted to know .
His teacher thought that he could be a teacher of math because he never got wrong on math tests .
So , his teacher told him to have more time in math , but he did n't want to do .
He wanted have broad knowledge because he did n't want to study one specific subject .
So , he studied and studied , but he could not go to a university because he was so poor .
After he graduated from his high school , he wanted to get a job .
Many companies did n't want to hire him because he did n't graduate from a university .
The companies wanted well-educated people on that time .
So , he worked as a darily worker .
He was not a formal worker , but he worked hard and hard .
While he worked , he still studied everything he could do .
After eight years later , he made some money .
He wanted to get a own company , so he opened a small market .
He already knew about how to do because he studied all the time he could do .
He used all knowledges to his market .
The market was getting bigger and bigger .
He got marry with pritty woman and he opened another market .
He opened four markets until he died .

In conculsion , I think It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific
