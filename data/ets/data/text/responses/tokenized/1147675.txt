I agree with the statement that `` Most advertisment products seem much better than they really are '' .
For two main reasons , first the main goal of advertisent is to sell and the seller would try to show their product the best they can .
On the other hand advertisement campains can make the consumer think that owning the product can make them fell or be a certain way .

As said in th introduction the main goal of advertisment is to sell , and make the likeable and atractive to the consumer .
These may result in distortioning the real product , for example food products , to be able to transmit a flavor , which is a sensation , on visual images , the advertiser needs to over show all the visual characteristis of a the product , this may result on a distortion of the real sizes and aparence of a food product .

As a second argument the advertisement can make consumer understand that by adquiring the product they can fell or be a certain way , for example women shampoo campains always show a prototipe of woman 's hair .
The consumer may asume that the type of hair that the person on the advertisment has would be the same as that she would adquire if she uses the product .
That does not necesarily means that the product seem much better than it is , just that the consumer is making assumptions over the product but this is a direct consecuence of the advertisment .

The wish of the producers to sell their product to te consumer may end up on a distortioning on the product by making them seem much better that they are , basicaly because of assumptions of the consumers is drawn to by the visual images of the advertisment .
