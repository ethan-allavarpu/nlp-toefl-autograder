Succes

I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
I agree with this statement because if a person do only what they know how to do the best , they are not chalenging them selves and become just like others , who dose not try their best , around you .
To challenge and to explore and taking risks will lead to a success .

To me the meaning of success is to do more then you can do .
To do more then what you are , you need to try new things or even new ways of trying and take risk doing it .
Eventualy your efort will pay you back in many areas .
The success could be diffrent then how rich you are .
The money dose not define success .

I belive that the success is not just about making money but how to be diffrent from other people like how much you know and have exprinced .
You may not be successful even after you try new things and taken risks .
But the exprience you have and more knowlege you have then others makes you successful .

The Success is in you .
How much you have improved from befor show how much successful you are .
When you succed on some thing that you thought it was hard but you tryed and take risk of failing .
That makes you successful and better then other not becuse you more money and power then others .
Every body have diffrent situation and diffrent level of success .
And if you succed in you the power and money will follow .

Thouse poeple who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well will succed no matter how much they have improved or how much richer you are .
You are a still better then you used to be and did not stay in your confort zone .
That is why I strongly agree with this statement .
