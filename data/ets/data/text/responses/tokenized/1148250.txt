Everybody can notice that nowadays the mass media is the most powerful thing that can leave a massive influence on us special on taneegers & children .
actually i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are & that is because of tow reasons .

The first reason is they do all the advertising about something in a wonderfull way that show you it is the best thing for you & you cant live without it .
Then , you discover all these advertising for nothing really worth it .
For example : once i watched on T.V an advertising about a straightner for the hair to make it straigh so they made that in a way that all the people will thought its really cool & you will have healthy hair , next i bought it & guess what ??
It was really bad , it destroyed & burned my hair .
Another example : my boyfriend was walking in the street & he saw posters about a rain-party , you can see from the posters that everything will be included the ticket but when he reached there everything in the poster was a lie .

The second reason , there is no sencor for the advertisements special on the internet , which that make alot of companies & shops do whatever they want & laughed at people .
once i met a friend she was really angry so i asked her whats going on ??
She told me that she pooked adress throught the internet & she paid for it but when she went there to take it they told her that she have to pay more because she didnt come at the same day .

In short , we must take-care of these kinds of advertisements , also you have to be sure with who you are dealing .
In my opinion the goverment should put sencor on the all advertisements in the mass media .
At the end dont forget to watch out & to think in a critical way when you communicate with these stuff .
