I disagree with this statement .
First , we can approuve this kind of opinions because we often heard about successful people whose success was a response to an new idea .
For instance , people who develop the chain-work in the industry of automobile used to take a lot of risks .
They did n't know if the demand was big enough to develop this kind of mass production , but they choose to take the risk and they were successful .
That 's why the statement we discuss is not totaly wrong , but I think that it 's not true .

My point is that I think that trying new things and taking risks are two of the keys factors to be successful , but are not caracteristics of successful people .
There are other factors to run well a business , like good opportunities .
Sometimes , you have a real good opportunitie and you choose to try , and that 's the key of your success .
Moreover , there are a lot of successful people who had a good idea at the beginnig , but who do n't take new risks for years .
For instance , Bill Gates is a realy successful person , but he does n't take risks nor than he tries new things .
He had develop the most famous firm in computer engineering , but he did n't try to diversify his activities .

Moreover , a lot of successful people based their success in a very particular fields .
They choose to become the best in what they do , and they do n't want to change their image by trying new activities .
So , they do n't try new things , they do n't take risks but they are successful because they know exactly how to do well what they do .
This is exactly the opposite of the statement we have to discuss .
And I do n't think it 's wrong .

To conclude , I think that there are not only one way to act when you are successful , and that 's why it 's really difficult to run a successful business .
Every successful business manager is different , and take different decision than an other manager in a same situation .
