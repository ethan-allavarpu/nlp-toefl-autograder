Some people think it is not necessary to learn many academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge from them .
However I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Because we can use our broad knowledge to our real lives .

Firstly , some people think it is not necessary to have broad knowledge .
Because they think it is waste of time and not necessary .
Moreover , it is really hard to learn variety of subjects .
For example , in Korea , Korean middle school force student to learn about 12 subjects .
But it became a serious problem in that the education program does not consider student 's ability or interest .
So recent research showed that more than 50 % of Korean middle school students are dissatisfied with their academic program and waste of time .
And average 30 students are going to study abroad a day .

However , I think the broad knowledge that we have learned is very valuable in that we can use them someday .
For example , I learned Home Economics and Technology in school .
At first , I was suspicious about that why I have to learn about things that I am not interested and not valuable .
But , one day , I had to cook food by myself because my parents were not at house .
I could n't think any of them .
And then , I could remember that I learned how to make a Korean traditional food called , `` Bulgogi '' .
So I could realize the importance of broad knowledge .

Overall , I think it is better to learn various academic subjects and obtain broad knowledge in that it will helpful for our lives .
Even though it is not related to one 's personal interest .
In my opinion , even though people do n't feel the necessity of learning various subjects , it does n't mean that they wasted time .
It has its meaning that they had tried .
