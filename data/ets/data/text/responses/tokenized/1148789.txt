It seems that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to help their communities , I agree with this statement .
But I have to say that it only seems that .
I have twenty years old , so I 'm young , and then I 'm part of young people .
Since my point of view I believe to things about this fact .
At first I would want to focus on the fact that young people help , young people want to help , they want the society to ask help to them , they have the necessity of knowing that they are part of something and that this part is useful and that society needs a lot of parts , society and their communities needs every young for running a better society and that they are needed .
Young people want the society to ask for them !

And that is where I want to arrive , nowadays society shows an image of the young people as if they are lazy people , as if they only want to have fun and to be with their friends .
And at least , as if society does n't expect no positive reaction of them .

A lot of young people travel abroad to underdeveloped countries to help as voluntieers .
The fact that is , they can be voluntieers on their own countries , they can take care of people around them , they can help in projects of beneficency in their countries , ...

But what happens ?
Most of the times their own communities do n't ask them help , they do n't know they can help in their own communities and built a better society .

In conclusion , I can state that society does n't encourage young people to help and that is because young people act in these two ways : They get relaxed because they believe socitey does n't expect anything of them ; or they travel abroad , to underdeveloped countries where young people believe that they really need their help .

Since my point of view , and apart of what I have say , there are people that are responsible with their communities and have the necessity and the aim to help in their own community and also , they view their community necessities and want to help and satisfy them as far as they can do it .
