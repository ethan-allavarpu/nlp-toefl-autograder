The real cliche advertisement is the one in which a beautiful young woman is eating a great yogourt in a terrific place such as a nice desert island .
Indeed very often the advertisement makes the product seem much better than it is actually .

This is really true when we talk about advertisement for goods such as food , cars , clothe . ..
Hoever it is not really the product that is shown as much better than it is but rather what is around the product .
Apparently you always need a cute girl , a handsome guy or a vaste shiny house to make sell a sausage or o Tshirt .
So it is more the stuff inconsciously linked to the product than the product itself that is shown as better than it really is .

Nevertheless in some cases the product is not shown as better than it is .
In particular when it is an advertising not on goods but on services .
For example the advertisments sensibilising on the security on the road , or the ad concerning lending money in a bank or concerning insurances .
In those cases the advertisement is more serious and there are less lies .

All things considered I agree that very often the y , butit is not the least surprising and ; ost people are aware of it .
The goal is to create a need and to increase the sells .

In a nutshell i would say that aadvertisment is trying to make products seem much better than in the reality but it is oftently true for goods and less for services .
But so ; eti ;
