Young peple nowadyas do not give enough time helping their communites , because they are busy with other things although these other things can help society .

Students can help their society in many diffrent ways like when they study and graduate they will take a job to work for their society , also all the parties and celebtrating fistival for the nautre and for the annivrsary of the city they are living in in a usefull things to society .

On the other hand alot of young people really help their society in very obvoius way , many students like to visit kids or old people in the hospital and help them , this is a very wonderful job from the students .

As I 'm a student I can see that this statments is not true and u can make it general to all students there is some students who is lazy and do not help , although there is students who like to help and have a helpfull and friendly manner .
