Car has became a part of life in the modern life .
car is very much essential today to do the things in the right time .
I disagree with the given statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

In the olden days man used to travel from place to another by walking .
the invention of the wheel chaged the evolution greatly .
after the invention of wheel man introduced many new vechicles for transportation .
he initially used bullock carts , tongas which were pulled by animals .
In the later life he introduced bicycle , which served him in travelling later he introduced motor cycle inorder to reach quickly with less effort , inthis process man thought for luxirious way of travelling and he started to introduced vechicles run by fuel .
he designed some of them for transportation of goods , and some for human , such as trucks , buses respectively .

And he later thought about the luxory and privacy , then brought the cars .
cars were luxirious means of transportation in the earlier .
but it is a compulsory now .
this change had occured because of globalisation and neccesities .
in the intial stages there very less number of cars , people used to see it very intrestingly .
but now days in the developed countries many are having more than one car .

The main problem with the cars is they create alot of traffic problems and also pollution .
for this reason many governments are trying to decrease cars by demanding for more tax , parkingamounts .

But pepole are ready to pay that because they very much edicted to it .
the question is that there will be less cars with in 20 years than now but ithink it will not happen .
the people possessing cars will not throw them out .

There will be many technologies come which will reduce pollution already some are using cars run by solar power .
The other reason is that popullation is increasing day - day .

And iconclude from the above reasons that after twenty years the number of will not be decreased instead the go on increase .
