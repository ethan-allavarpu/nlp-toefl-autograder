The best way to train and improve our intelligence is to make the brain work by understanding and analyzing different concepts .
Therefore I definitely agree with this statement : brain 's exercises are more usefull and important than memoy 's exercises .

The first step in the education of any human brain is to learn how to study and understand a new idea .
Learning by memorizing new facts is only a mechanical exercise that can not increase our intelligence .
Therefore if we can understand a concept , we will be able to remember it and it will be part of our knowledge for ever .

Sometimes students try to learn facts because they think that it is an easyer way to learn ; but this idea is completely wrong .
Only understanding the real and essential meaning of a new concept , the student will be confident and able to use it in his future .

In addition , it 's important to underline that the rule of teachers is to encourage students to analyze and study new ideas .
For example , I remember in my high school the support of my favourite teacher who was trying to teach me how important is to study deeper any subjects instead of learn facts .

In conclusion , I want to emphatize again the importance to understand ideas and concepts because is the best way to increase our knowledge and our intelligence : that is the real exercise for the human brain . .
