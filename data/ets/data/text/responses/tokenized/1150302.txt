I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The purpose of the adverstisements is to convince people to buy the products in a shot time .
In the modern world there are so many messages trying to catch the attention of the people that reaching this goal is not easy .
The advertisement has to be really effective in order to being read and to drive the purchaising behavior .
Overstating the functionalities of the product can be a mean to reach this goal .

If we think to some advertisements and to the related products it 's easy to find the differences between the picture and the descriptin of the product and the product itself .
That means that we are aware of the `` overstating techinque '' used by the advertisers and that we do n't fully believe in the messages that they convey .
I never expect the kitchen 's cleaning soaps to clean my kitchen as they do in the advertisements !
And I never expect the breakfast 's biscuits to have the perfect shape they are showing on every paper pages an during every commercia !
We are all used to adopt a certain `` discount ratio '' while evaluating the advertisements messages .
The difficult think for advertisers is to balance the reality with the overstatement in their advertisements because if the messages are too distant from the reality the risk is loosing the client after the first try of the product .
