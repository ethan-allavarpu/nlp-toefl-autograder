With the development of our country 's economic .
Travelling becomes a new fashion of spending the time of holiday .
Now there is a heated concerning over whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Some people think travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best choice .
From their point of views , the guide will give you a plan and arrange your travelling route .
Well , this might be good , if the place you want to go is in the plan of the tour guide .
However , as far as I am concerned , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not the best choice .
I prefer travelling alone .

First and foremost , trave by oneself can do whatever you want to .
You can go on the internet , search the place you admire , learn more knowledge about it , find the way to it .
The following thing is to find some time , pick up your bag , take some food , go directly to the place you want .
You do not need to go to the place you are not interested in or you have ever been to .

Equally important is that the time for travelling by oneself is flexible .
You can do travelling by any time in any season .
If you appreciate some places of interests , just stay a little long , look around more about it .
It does no matter with others .
While in a group , you have to respect the opinion of others ' .

In the end , another point that we should not forget is that some tour guiders will take travellers to some place that people do not want to .
Guiders may take travellers to some local markets where the price are very high .
Meanwhile , the goods are inferior .

All in all , I disagree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Travelling by one 's own wiil much happier .
