Although many people tend to avoid trying new things and take risks , I oppose to that attitude because to me it seems to be boring doing always the same .
On the one hand , if you take risks , there is always the danger to fail .
Depending on how great the risk is , you may loose nearly everything you possess .
Admittedly , this is a even harder decision , if you are responsible for a family .
I remember a time in my childhood , when my father thought of expanding his local drug store .
Certainly it had been a great chance but after severel sleepless nights he decided not to take the risk due to his care about his family .
In addition , trying something new always comes together with a lot of hard work .
Why should you do it , if you can hold your status with a work you know to do well ?

In my opininion , you do it , because you will get rewarded , if you try something new .
I find , trying out new things is fun and interesting .
In other words , when I try something new , I have the wonderful chance to broaden my horizons .
If you never give it a try , you will never experience if there is something you would like better .
I , for example , invested all my money during my studies to open a small copy shop for co-eds .
What I received back from this little business was not only the money to finance my studies , but also the unvaluable experience of applying my theoretical knowledge from university to the real business world .
This helped me a lot to succeed .

In a nutshell , I agree that it is more comfortable to do only the things you know well .
However , risking something improves our experience and provokes innovation , the latter being one of the key factors that thrive our economy .
