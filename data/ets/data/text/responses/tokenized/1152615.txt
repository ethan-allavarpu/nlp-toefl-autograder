I agree with the statement that most advertise show more facts of the products than they really have and make it much more easy to be saled .
This phonomenen are showed almost all over the world and I think it is reasonable to be accept .

The first reason is that , the advertise is mean to show the good effects of the products and appeals people to buy them .
It is the use of the advertizing .
People who make advertise always study the merchanes carefully and make it more useful and more worthful to buy .
They of cause will show a lot of unconvince facts to be convinced .
Just even a piece of papper can be discribed to have the capability to make user more healthy than use other kind of pappers .
You may think it is rediculers , but the advertise offen make those problems .

Second , the company pay for the advertisement is focus on the profits of it .
The company do this things just because it want to increase its sales and make more money back .
Input and output is the first thing to a company .
So the manerge people want to make the products more attractable to the market .
And the advertise will be as better as it could be .
No concern about the facts .
There are many illigle advertises in China that misleading people and make terrible effects to the society .

The last reason is , sometimes , people are like to see some amazing things in the advertisement though they do not believe it .
For example , a women who is not so fit may want to see some medicines that can help people to lose weight .
And she may dream that she could be as beautiful as the ficture shown at the advertisement .
She dose not want a really product , but just a dream .

So the advertisement offen seem much better than they really are and accepteble to the society .
