Every thing in life have changed and this the fact that we can not diny and than we will give the exaccuse to the youg that they are not doing like the parents used to do to their communities and I agree that they do not .

First the sociaty has chaged as their is no plenty of time as the old ginaration had for example the trafic and the communication now aday have more time and efford to go from place to place more than the time in the paset with the parents so the youg man does not have the time to finsh his won needs and does not have the time to care with others , and also if we are taking in the same point of the communicatin it became more expansive to go from a place to another and the youg does not have this enough money to go to help in other place .

Second the youg people have alot kind of intertenment in the life more than the last generation has for example the youg people have a lot of movies they can go to wath and there is alot of places he can go with hes friends so in his fre time he will prefer to go for dinner or movies insted of going to help the communities in th cummun fields like the parets did .

Third I thik that the sestem of the aducation is also responsible of this case as they did not teach the youth in the schools the meanining and loving to help others in the community and how to be mumeber so when they grow and graduid they do not try to help as they did not learn how to do

And to sum up and with all the sttment suggested above I think that we are all responseble of this case of the youth the parent in the house did not teacth them how to love their community aaaand how to help it and also the school the media we are all responsible and if did not care for this problim we will not gain in the future the good result we all aim from those young people .
