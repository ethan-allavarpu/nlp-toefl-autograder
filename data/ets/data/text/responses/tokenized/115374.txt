I disagree with the statement .
for me , being successful has very little to do with the amount of material things one has accumulated .
To be successful , one has to be happy .
the two things go together .
One might say it is possible to achieve both things , but i thing for that one would have to dedicate most of his or her time for that purpose .
To try new things and take risks rather than doing what one already knows how to do well , time will pass one by .
Therewill be no time to enjoy the success .
Success is doing what one loves , doing it well , make agood living out of it while enjoying the rest of the time with the persons you love .
What will being loaded with material things if you do n't have time to supervise your children school progress / Definitely , I would rather be very good in what I do , do it well , make a good living from it and enjoy life afterward with family , friends , loved one instead of trying new things over and over again ,
