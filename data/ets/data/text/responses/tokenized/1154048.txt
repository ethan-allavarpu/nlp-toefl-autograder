I dont really agree with this statement that `` most advertisements make products much better than they really are '' .
Because it aways happens in the other way , that they will not be much better than they really are or they really seem to be .
Here comes the difference , they will advertise the product by showing its good qualities and the way it works or so on , but they wil not show its defects , they will not count on those .
Perhaps they seem much better when they advertise them and they will convince us to buy it , its after that all happens that we will come to know about the actual performance of it , which is really worse .

But sometimes it happens that the products seem much better than they really are , but note it , sometimes only , it just very rare .
I will give you live example which has been experienced by me in the past .
Once i bought a video-cd player , convinced by the products advertisement in which it was shown all its good qualities and said its performs better than the remaining ones in the market .
So i bought it thinking that it will be a better option to buy the product of that company .
But i was completely wrong in my choice , because it was always subjecting to repairs and it was not working properly .
I went wrong in selecting , by seeing the advertisement .

Another example is an experience of my friend with a cosmetic product which promises to glow your skin , bought it by seeing the advertisement and thinking it will make her skin glow , instead it left itching of the skin and allergy of skin .
So , i strongly stick to my opinion that they are not as much better as they seem to be .
I conclude by saying that i disagree with the statement .
