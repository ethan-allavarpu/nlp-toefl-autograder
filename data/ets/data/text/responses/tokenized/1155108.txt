I am agree , students need to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because that will make easier in the time to study for the test , and will be able to participate any time the teacher aks a question , it is really important to understand everything about the subject that helps to earn time , to study for all subjects .

A clear example I had , in Quemistry is a class in which you have to understand what the teacher is explaining because it has some exercises that even if you study you ca n't figure it out easily , so everytime I did not understand I asked my teacher .
And I successfully got a good grade .

Many times students are to shy and they are afraid to ask somebody to help her in a different subject , or even the teacher does n't like to help student , so we as student we need to have a positive mind and fight for what we want , doing our best at school and been obedient following directions .

Another example I have , I am really proud of my sister she is really smart , in her test she always got good grades , and I ask her if she can give me some clues , and the answer I received from her is that I have to understand what I am reading or studying so I try to understand , now I am successful in my subjects and in my own life .

Finally , I can encourage all students have a positive mind and put their hearts on God , He is the only person we can trust .
