As we know every community was builded by their people .
People such old persons or young persons work together to make great nations and provide good life .

In my opinion , I dont agree with the following statement `` young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping thier communities '' .
Becouse the most important role in creating any powerful nation is her young people .
Becouse they have the powerful and young mind to keep developing it .
Nation that give the hand and support for its young people we found it aproud of its acheviments .
Young people are participate in different side of coumminty .
They work in teaching , engineering , medicene , and hand crafts to provide the good environment of raising new generations of young people .
These new generations will continue carrying the future of the nation and its development .
As we see today , in lebanon were the war is killing all people and destroying building .
Young people stand thier to help their nation in hospitals and in places war arrive to it .
And to share them their pain and fear .
While other young people are standing to defend their lands from this war and its results .
Young people give their lifes for the community and the nation should be the examples and the leaders for all young people around the world .

Finaly , nations and communities are measured by thier young people and their achivements .
More powerful young people , more powerful nation it is an easy eqaution have just two variables .
And the young people who raised on old people hands continue to carry the message for all generations come after .
