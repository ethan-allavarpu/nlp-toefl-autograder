In our studies , we often have the choice between learning many academic subjects and specialize in one in particular .
It can be quite a dillema .
In my opinion , specializing , at least in the end of our studies , is more interresting .
I will explain the advantage and disadvantage of each solution and explicit my feelings .

Broad knowledge of academic subjects is appealing at first .
You do n't have to make the choice between the themes you like , and learning from one can improve our understanding of another .
For instance , learning the living of species in biology class can help in ecology class .
Swithing between subjects often also help on not getting bored .
On the contrary you do n't have enough time to each class , and that can be really frustrating to learn only basics in the one you enjoy the most .

The other choice that is offered to us is specializing .
The great thing about it is learning more and more information about a subject you like ( or at least you should like ) and getting more and more confident about it .
Furtheremore you make less mistakes .
The major drawback is when you need knowledge ( even basic ) on other academic subjects you do n't have them , and probably do n't have the time to learn them , and need to ask for help .
This will result in a huge loss of time .
An other negative aspect about specializing is that sometimes you are to much concentrate on your subject you ca n't see by yourself the mistake you are doing .

Finally , i prefer to specialize in a topic than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
The main reason is that you can be good in a topic only if you practice often , and i do n't mind asking for help if i need knowledge about another subject in order to fullfil my work .
Moreover , in order to begin in profesional life you need to be good at least one thing .
