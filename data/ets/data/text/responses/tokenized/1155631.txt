If people have to try new things , in order to become successful , depends on the kind of success of those people .
For me it is clear that people have to take risks , in order to achive there goals , if they start a new business .
Pushing the own company to success , is not just related with hard work , but also with the ability to take risks .
Going new ways has many advantages .
For instance , the company has less competition .
In addition , the costumer 's are usually open for new ideas and product 's .
Thus , going new way in combination with hard work , could lead to the desired goal .

Moreover , one imagine an enterprenuer who is willing to achive success in a businees , just by hard work and an old idea .
It is clear tha he will stand against a huge competi On the other hand , if the person is employed , it could be more efficient to just consentrate on the things which he can do well and what is requiered in his position .
In fact , person 's who consentrate on there abilities and push them furthermore , are more likely to become promoted then employees who are often trying new things .
However , since promotion is the most important thing in an employees life , I disagree with the above mentioned statment .

In addition , people who wa n't to get in power , even in a multinational company , would go better , if they learn the structure of the company well , instead of greating it new .

In summ , it could be said that success is for different people different .
Nevertheless , to be successful , people have to be aware of many aspects .
In addition they must have a varity of abilities , but for each business there are other rules .
