Successful people have different ways and strategies to be unique and successful among the others .
The main ways of successful are either , by taking the risks or by doing and applying what they already know or plan for .
The two types of people might consider different factors in their living environment that will guide them to the best succeeding path or way .

People who like to take risks , their surrounding evironment forces them or encourage them to take the risks .
Their environment might be poor , tough , or has a lot of shortages so this will let them search for new and creative ways to satisfy their needs , and these ways mostly risky because no one have ever tried their ways before .
An example for this , is the inventors case .
Inventors taked the risk to tried risky or unfamiliar procedures to come up with a unique , new usaable invention that turned their life into the sucessful life .
Another example is a company owner , who will take a risky decision to solve an wanted or sudden market conditions .

People who like to do what they planned for , are usually have a stable life and environment .
They go through regular path as any one else , but they do more effort and plan wisely to achieve their predetermined goals .
Most of people from this type do not like to take risk before making an intensive analysis for all the consecutive results for taking any risk .
As a result they will end up with not changing their plans .
An example of this , are people who does not like to change their career .
Or the people who take the same path as their fathers or mothers , for example being a doctor or professor in the college same as their parents .

In my opinion I like to do what I already planned for , with out taking the risk .
Because it is more safer for my career and social position , also I do not have the strong ability to find alternative solutions in case of failure of any risky action .
More over it is more convenient for me to live in the same pattern through my life with a reasonable improvement same as the average people .
I also strongly consider my stable life that does not force me to take any risk .
