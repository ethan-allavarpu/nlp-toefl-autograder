For a centuries , there are many inventions that change our life a lot .
One of those inventions is automobile that we use almost everday .
Some people consider that car use might decrease little by little , and I agree with this idea .
These days , many people , including me , worry about that population might reduce in the future , and because of that , car use might decrease , too .
Also , thanks to developing technology , public transportaiton becomes much more convenient now , so this could be one of reasons that people use car less in the future .

Nowadays , many people concern that population might decrease in the future .
According to investigation , population rate is focused in elder class people .
One of reasons is developed medical technology .
Moreover , more women go out to work , recently , they usually refuse to have baby because they will not be able to avoid to quit their work .
Because of that , in the future , there might be less population in the world , and car use might be down , too .

As technology develop , public transportation is now much more convenient than when it began .
In Korea , there is almost no facilities , such as elevator to support injured people like Japan .
However , this year , when I went there , there are many elevators to support those people .
Now , still there are many cars in the street , but people might use more public transportation in the future because it is pretty cheap despite of convenience .

As I mentioned , in the future , less people use cars .
Of course , still many people use their own car because it is convenient , too .
However , less population helps to be down less use of car , and more people will use public transportation , which become more convenient .
