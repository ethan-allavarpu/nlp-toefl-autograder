I quite agree with statement , that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Being young means lot of energy .
Young people have more energy than as compared to any older person .
More energy help them to take part in more activies .
Though this could be only true if these energies are spend towards positive activies .

When a person is young , he is always in learing stage .
So many times they may come across new places and new things , they will enjoy knowing about it , because it would be their first interaction with it .
E.g. simple driving , young people may find it more joyfull than older ones .
Because driving would be relatively a new activity for them as compared with older ones , who could be frusted will daliy traffics and other issues related to it .

If you ask this same question to a school children during their exams , it can be expected what theirs answers could be .
But during their vaction time , it may be opposite .
This lets us know , how immature a humanbeing is when he is in his young ages .
Immature humanbeing , mean do n't understand reponsibilites towards their life than a older person could understand .
In short a young person could have less responsibilites in his life compared wiht a older person , which puts a older person to in more stressed life .

Said all these , life is great .
Its better we understand our different stages of life and enjoy its each stage as it comes .
Each stage of a life has its own beauty , to lead a happy life , one should understand this and should enjoy his or her life to most no matter in what age he or she is
