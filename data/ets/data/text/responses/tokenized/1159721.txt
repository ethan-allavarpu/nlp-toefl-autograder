Nowadays the car is connected to our everyday life so much more than any other way of transporting is .
We often use car to go to work or to go to school , we use car in order to be somewhere else in the less time it is possible ; we use car also , and maybe first of all , for going out in the evening , when buses and tubes are maybe full of no raccomanded peoples and somethings like that . ..

On one hand car is for sure our best way of transporting because it is easy to use and it needs not to be in queue for the tikets for example , but I think that the real question is :
Is the car really the best solution , the best urban solution to reach a place , to go to somewhere ?
Or maybe would the car be one day a real problem in our everyday lives , instead ?
I think that the answer is that in a few years the car will be the worst way of transporting because of the increasing number of drivers in the streets , and most of all because of the incoming problem of the pollution !

According to me , in the end , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today as a natural consequence of the improving of our own lives .
I think also that my opinion is supported by all those experiments that scientists and ingenieers are doing in order to convert our way of moving in a city with alternatives way of transportings and also with alternatives carburants maybe less nocives .
For example I think that in the future our cities will support much more transporting by train than by car in order to move much more people at a time , eliminating problems connected with traffic and pollution .
