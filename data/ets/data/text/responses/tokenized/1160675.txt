Always is better to understand facts .

As student , I really think it it easer for us to understand a topic by using examples and learning facts .
When students just see the concept in class or the definition about something it 's dificult to them to rebemeber it just as they saw it in class , but if they see an specifically case about the same concept it will be easier to keep it in mind , because they can relate it to the real life .

For example , last semester in my human reasources class I had a teacher that always helped us to relate the theory with the practice , I remember one class where we saw what an interview was and in what consisted , and she took a classmate to make him an interview explaning all the steps we need it to do to make it right , and showing the most common mistakes that we could commit .

I remind it was so enriched for everybody in class , and after that when I entered to my fist job , I could rememeber everything I had learned and I took it to the reality .

When we learn facts it also helps us to convey it with our own experiences .

On the other hand , I have had classes where we get full of concepts and definitions of some subjects but we really do n't know how to put it in practice and I do think all this information goes away .

In conclusion , to learn in a classroom or out of it will be always better to usderstand facts and to related with reality , and also it will be easier for us to explain and to teach somebody else , because we have already absorbed this infomation , and proffesors should do this with the students since they are kids to provide them an important tool to learn better .
