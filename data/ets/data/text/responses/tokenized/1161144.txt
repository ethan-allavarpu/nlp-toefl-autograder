I personally think that if someone has a broad knowledge on many subjects , he will be able to find a solution on a larger amount of problems in life/work .
If a person has to solve problems on his own and ca n't cooperate with other people , he would certainly be advantaged with this type of knowledge .

On the contrary , if a society is well organized and all the parts that cooperate are well prepared just on a specific subject ( obviously each part has a different subject ) , efficiency can be increased a lot making the society very competitive .

Taking the statement from a more personal point of view makes me think about those people considered as `` genius '' , that improoved a lot in a specific field but consequently had a lack of knowledge in other fields , for example social relationship .
This makes them suffer and escape different situations just because they ca n't stand them .

The genius creates something with his ability that will always be remembered and appreciated , but he has to suffer for it .
Actually I wish I was a genius on something , but at the same time I like the way I was educated so i find myself in agreement with the statement .
