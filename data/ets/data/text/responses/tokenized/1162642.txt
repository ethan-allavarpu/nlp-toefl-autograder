I agree with the statement that advertisement make products seem much better .
it is because of my thought , survey , poll , and experiments

First , famouse person usally make most advertisements .
It appeal to peoples enoughly .
most person want to be like actor , singer , and actress .
Maybe the product that is advertised by superstar is more attractive to the people .

Scondly , the survey , conducted by cho-sun daily , one of the best paper in Korea , show that three of fourth of overall candidates of survey feel advertised products more quailified .
Also the poll , conducted by same company , show that people think that advertised products is more safe .

Thirdly , when I was a high school student , my friend bought a product that is not advertised .
It was expensive tape player .
It was disorder in next day .
My friend want to get gerentee service .
He does not get it .
So he have to buy again and he buy advertised product , SONY , because of services .

Lastly , When I was young , I had two toys .
I do not had discremination between two toys .
However , I was perfectly changed in my mind after advertisement of superman , my hero in the past .
Although the toy is much cheeper than another , I alway take superman 's toy Because I had proud of myself .

In the conclusion , Given several reasons , I thinks that most advertisement make the products seem much better than they really .
It seems that advertisement make us atractive to the product . ..
