I have a quite open opinion about the statement that `` In twenty yearsthere will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
On the one hand I would totally agree this .
Each day you can read somewhere in the newspapers , how the prices if petroil increase from day to day .
Petroil reached his highest price and there might be no decrease in the next years .
As well as the limited oil reserves which begin to reduce every hours , it will be difficult to drice a car .
Perhaps people will wake up and use the public transports , like the bus or train .
That would lead to a better environment , because pollution and noise would reduce .
As we could also see with the transrapid the public transportation development is great .

On the other hand we all see that there is no ending of new car producing .
Nearly each inhabitant over 18 - years has once drove a car .
Unfortunately for a lot of people , cars are a symbol of standard and lifestyle .
They like to express their positon in the society .
Some also dont want to give up driving a car , because it is a comfortable way of getting somewhere quick and easily .
for a lot of people , especially men , cars are more than only a thing to transport them .
It is a playing thing , which they like to show and compare with others .

Conclusively , I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years because some people in future have to stop driving their own cars .
Insurance and petroil will become too expensive , when the prices will further increase .
