I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

In my observation from the successful businessmen or professors , they often do things or sucjects what other people do not understand at all .
For example , ten years ago , while most people do not know values and benefits of the computer , but Bill Gates knew it .
Because he went ahead and tried the new things ( computer ) , he made a real big fortune from doing latest technology .

On contrary to those persons who only do what they known , successful persons are always trying new things .
They usually have a open mind to absorb all the latest concept , and they often take risks .
For instance , if a businessman adopt the idea that he never heard before , it must be very risky to use it if the idea is not pratical to operate .

There will be two different ways for using the new thoughts : success or fail .
Most people will not dare to adopt new things because they are afraid that they may lose everything .
In this way , they gradually developed the idea that they do not want to learn the new things and take advantage of them .

In contast , this idea seldom be formed in the heart of successful people .
They , of course , know the risks might be , but they are not afraid .
Successful people usually have a positive mind to keep them go ahead .

In conclusion , I think that I truly agree the opinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
