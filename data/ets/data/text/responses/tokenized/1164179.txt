This is a very hard discussed question and I believe everybody you ask tells you a different answer about this aspect of the generation gap .
But with the tendency that always the other group is accused to be more enjoying as the one you belong to .
So everybodies opinion as a young or older person could be affected by such an influence .
Thus I am trying not to be affected by such group thinking .

I would say in the overall majority of our society is enjoying their life , although the older people do it more .
Surely one could say the young are lazy and the only thing they have in mind is making party .
But I think that relates to their younger and more active body and mind .
And I am convinced the relatively short time young peolple party can not be compared to the long periods the older people sit around watching tv , play poker , or spend their free time in female chatting clubs .
Of course there may be several older people that use their time efficiently by working , keeping the front yard nice or be active in a sports club .
There are also people who are ill and can not do what they have in mind .
But in summary I want to make a statement about the mean , the normal , older person .

Young peolple are simply doing much more , in both fields enjoing and working , than older ones .
I do not know of any of my friends or studymates to think of life as only joy .
They are all working hard and learning in schools , universities or learning a handworkers profession to provide the best possible opportunity to get a job and earn money to run a family .
Especially in todays time of mass unemployment the younger must perform more not to be one of the workless .
That was different in the last decades , when getting work was no problem and there existed shortage in factory workers .
Today workers must have a profession and be well preperated for their job .

The older generation is now enjoying their dusk of life in a financially saved situation .
When the young people will be the old the situation will certainly have changed to worse .
