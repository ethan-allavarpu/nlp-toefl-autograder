Travelling has become part of our living such as eating , drinking , exercising etc . .
But why do people travel a lot nowadays ?
FirsfThe reason why people are willing to travel is to be open to other cultures and traditions , they can also meet other people from a different ethnic background or religion in order to exchange new ideas and form opinions from all that or simply take a short period of time to relax and that is called ` vacation ' .

In fact , when we decide to travel , we usually need someone to lead us otherwise we 'll get lost and be deceived , moreover we might also find it really tiring and fruitless since everything is new to us we need some time to get accustomed to that new country .
On the one hand , we can buy guiding books and maps and on the other hand we can hire a tour guide .
Which one of the above means is effective ?

In my opinion , a tour guide is necessary because he can be really helpful by making us visiting the most interesting spots or the famous ones and it 's easier of course as we wo n't to rent a car or look for taxis everytime we need to visit a new place .
Moreover , he 'll be well acquainted to his native country and tell us additional things that sometimes are n't revealed in books and we can ask him all the questions we would like to ask whereas by using a book , we do n't get really satisfied with the results and it does n't all that huge amount of information given by that guide .
Another interesting point is the reason why people prefer travelling by groups instead of travelling alone is because they just want to enjoy their times and leave some souvenirs of that trip .

At last , according to my experiences , i would suggest that the best way of travelling would be in groups and guided by a tour .
