The statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' is an important point , which plays a big role in society , especially in education .

On the one hand you can agree with this statement , because it is very important to have a basic background of education .
You should know the basic facts in different academic subjects .
This way of thinking we can find in schools .
At school the pupils are eccept to be good in every subject .
The souhld be good at maths , languages , biology , chemistry and sports .
So a pupil has to concentrate for every subject to achieve good results after school .

On the other hand critical people would ask : `` Why should a pupil , who is good and very interested in maths be also good and interestesd in sports ? ''
This would be the other way of thinking .
Some parents for example think that is enough when pupil are talented in certain subjects , because after school they go to a university , where they also concentrate just on a special subject , which they choose to study .

I am of the opinion that a mix of two ways is the best solution .
I think , people and espaccially children , should have a basic education in ervery subject .
It makes no sense to send a child very early to a school , which is based on a special subject , like a science school for example or a sports school .
Pupils should learn the basic information in poltics or in geography and other important subjects .
I think it is a good way to send children firstly on a normal school and after graduating pupils have to decide on their own , where they want to go and wich university mostly agrees with their own interests .
So the pupils would have a basic knowledge which you need in society and after this they can concentrate on a special subject .
