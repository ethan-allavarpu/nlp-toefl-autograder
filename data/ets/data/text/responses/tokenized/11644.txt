I agree with this statement .
Basically , travel should be enjoyable and fun to talk many people on during tour group , not only people local cevilians .
On a group tour have more chance to talk people than travel alone .
First , traveler will be a friend with tour guide , that is a first oppotunity .
There is many advantage that travel in a group led by a tour guide .
First of all , travelers just follow tour guide .
It is neccesary to make any tour plan or sightsee schedule .
Just listen and see what tour guide explains and sightseeing spot .
Travelers concentrate what ever they want to see or whatever they want to learn or listen .
Secondly , travel with group led by a tour guide is safer .
Tour guide have a responsibility to be in safe with travelers that means travelers do not go to any unpeace place .
Even travelers does n't know sightseeing place is safe or not , definitely safe during tour .
In case travel alone or no local friend , nobody know if travelers in unpeace place or not .
It is danger .
Thirdly , travel with group led by a tour guide will be convenience .
Which means , travelers do n't wast a time as lost in place , do n't wast a money by cheat .
As I mentioned above , sightseeing place and time schedule were scheduled by tour guide .
So travelers going on schedule that means there is no way to wast time and see anything travelers want , and travelers going in safe place to buy such as in shopping mall or meal .
There is no way to anyone cheat them .
Those reasons are not only domestic travel .
I can say it internatinal travel as well .
I recommend to go to travel with group led by a tour guide especially internetinal travel .
Without saying , people in foreign country speaks different lunguage than travelers and there is not peacefull place .
Those are reasons why I agree with statement .
