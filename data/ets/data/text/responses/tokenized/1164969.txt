Today advertisement can convice consumers that every kind of product is the best one and that you ca n't live without it .
There are a lot of tecniques that make a product irresistible for consumers .
But is always true that all advertised products are so good like it seem to be ?
I think is not : they seem much better than they really are .
Last week I bought an apple pie that I saw on a television spot .
In the images reported on tv it seems realy testy and healthy , but when I eat it , it was not so good and I got sick .
I could n't sleep all night long .

In my opinion it would be better for food or dress companies to spend their budjet improving the quality of their products or decreasing the prices instead of invest it on advertisement .

The problem is that business rules are different from what is better for the people .
But something has to be done .
I think that certification of qulity are a very good investment for the companies to show the real value of their product end in the same time a good way for consumers to verify the quality of what they are buying and choice better between different brands .
