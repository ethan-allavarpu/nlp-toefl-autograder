I think the best way to travel is by alone , not in a group led by tour guide .
In my country , there are a lot of tour agencies to different countries .
However , traveling should definetly alone because there is not much time the guide gives , traveling alone is more flexible to control time and place to go , and tour information they five can be found indivisual .

In my personal experience , tour guide gives not enough time to see something in one site .
For example , I once had a travel to Northeastern United States .
I went to New york first .
one amazing place was Broadway .
Those musical posters , commercials , and stores attracted me .
However , the guide gave me only one hour .
I wanted to visit the stores and see a musical , but in one hour , all I could do was take photoes and buy a suvenier .
If someone is going to travel , He must have flexible time to stay and do something they want to do .
Musical , cup of cofee or shopping is their choice .

If people travel alone or by their personal group , they are more flexible in time and deciding where to go .
When I was in Cuba , I wanted to go to the beach , but the day , it was rainy , so I changed my plan to stay indoor .
and at evening I enjoyed dinner on cool temperature beach .
If someone travel in group with tour guide , you can not change plans , You may go to beach on a rainy day .
Also , you might go to somewhere you do n't want to go and waste hours in a bus .

People find tour guides because they are not good in that place .
However , inventon of internet , and so much books about that place , tells everything about it .
people can find maps , place where view is good , where to eat delicious food .
Then people can choose place to go by themselves .
My parents , once went to Italy , with only a book , and enjoyed everything without problems .

For these reasons , it is fun and also very practical to travel alone or in a personal groups .
Flexible scedules and indivisual preference is the most important thing when people travel indeed .
