In our life , all of us want to live in good , confortable conditions , want to have a big house and also a nice car and money till death .
But for this suitable life can not be won easily .
It wants successful .
And for the success ; open mind , risk and new trials are necessary .

There are two kinds of people .
One of what is successful and the other is unsuccessful in the life .
In my opinion , successfull people are open minded and always ready to try something new and try to develop a process or a project or a subject .
In addition to these they like to take risks for the success .
But on the other hand , some people stay away from risk , new projects and also they are afraid of trials .
They live according to their life rules .

If we focus on the professors-scholars working , educating and researching in the universities , colleges and also in institudes , we could determine the success on their faces by investigating their reliable behaviours , talkings , smilings . ..
etc we know that they dont get afraid of making mistakes becouse they believe that if they m make mistake it will turn to them as success On the other hand if the other people afraid of making mistakes , taking risk and stay dependent on their own rules , could not be successful .
For example , if an unsuccessfull student is investigated , according to the student behaviour and life , random study times that was set by her/hisself could be determined .

In conclusion it could be said that successfull people are the people who are not afraid of making mistakes and in addition to these who are not to take risk .
They are always ready to find out something and development .
But as comparised above , to do wahot is wanted does not bring any success and olso a comfortable life we imagine .
If life is just like a stairs for people having beauties confort miney on the upside , in my opinion successfull people will go up easily but the others will not .
