I disagree with the saying that understanding ideas and concepts is important for a student than it is to learn facts .
ideas gives the student a invoke for what and how a task has to be done .
concepts are studied from the earlier editions of books and from some written or , generally saying , from an abstract on wat is already done .
concept also means basic idea of what is to be done .
concept is the general background of any subject considered .
ofcourse , without concept nothing is done properly , for example taking a major .
A student does not catch up with the course if he has no idea about the concept or the basics of the course .

Facts is a very lively word to listen .
fact explains which is true , true and only true .
facts are the things to be considered in every particular task .
According to me , learning facts always puts us in the place where we have to be .
Learning facts sounds to something like behaviour , personal experience , something done .
for example , giving a test wchich is relly new to a student .
he has to give many practice tests in order to face the experience when on the real test .
if the student just goes to the test with all ideas and fully known concept , it woud not be that good resulting as it would be when he takes practise test before .

Another example is putting up a new business.a man planning to start a new business , he has to learn the ideas , the concept of marketing , and as well the experiense .
he has to observe some businessman , how they work with the daily shares .
having an idea an the basic knowledge about the business does not just click into the market .
there would be less profit in the work done without learning facts .

So , these observations conclude that half knowledge is always dangerous .
thus , i disagree with the saying , more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
