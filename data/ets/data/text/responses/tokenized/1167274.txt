Nowadays advertisements have a big impact on our lives .
They can be very infuencial on our decisions and choices related to the our shops .
We can find them everywhere , on television while we are watching a movie or a show , on newspaper , on internet and also on the streets .
Sometimes when we open our mail box we find a lot of advertisements about for example restaurant and shops .

Not always what they tell describe the real qualities of a product .
In fact I think that often they make products seem much better then they are .
Sometimes for example we buy a product because we have heard so much about it and its incredible properties but latter when we use it we realize that we have been stupid .

In fact the product quality does not corrisponds with the description in the spot and furthermore we have problably spent more buying it instead of a similar product which was not advertised .

In particular I believe that these advertisement are more powerful with children .
In fact they usually ask their parents to buy a game or a pair of shoes because they have seen them on television , they have been attracted by the presentation of this product and they really believe that they can reproduce what is showed on these advertisements .

In conclusion I think that it is better to be a little doubtful when we see these spots .
When we buy a product we have to be carefull because sometimes a common product which we have not ever see before can shows the same properties and qualities of the one which is advertised .
We will problably save money .
