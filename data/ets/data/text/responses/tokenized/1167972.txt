It is often said that group tour is more beneficial than travel alone .
Some people might agree with this statement because group tour is not lonely and a tour gruide will guide best travel attractions .
However I firmly believe that travel alone is the best way to travel .
It is far more comfortable .
Also I can do what I really want to do without any regulations .

To begin with , a single tour makes me feel very comfortable .
Usually group tour is little bit noisy and confusing .
But individual travel will be possible to a calm , peaceful and cozy tour .
For example , when I was going to Japan , I went there with group .
Our tour group members were 15 .
So every we moved other location , I had to wait until all members were ready to move .
Waiting too much was made me anger .
After came back to my country I thought if I had go to japan alone , it will be a much great memorable travel for me .

Also , individual travel gives a great opportunity to encourage independence and endurance .
When people travel alone , there are no regulation so people can do what they really want to do .
They should planned by oneself and should decide what they eat and where they house .
By deciding these things they will be learn many things which could n't learn on the books .
For instance when I was senior , I planned to go to america for 4weeks .
I did reserve airplanes , restaurants and hotels .
At that time .
it was very hard time for me .
But now , I think through these tour , I can be learn independence , improve my language skills , and broaden my social relationships .
