Is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ?
there are going to be millions of places that you may have not seen or never heard before , new cultures to explore , new ways of learning of doing something that probably you did n't even thought it existed .

Traveling with a tour guide it 's probably a good choice if your idea is go and see the city , to know waht it 's the history behind it , but if your thing it 's not that than it 's not a good choice traveling with a tour guide .

In my personal experiences i had always wanted to see the cities for myself , but in my case i 'm also more intersted in the nightlife too , so i thinking that i will not be taking the tour guide to a night out in the city which i prefer spending it with my friends out .

Another thing would depend on what it 's your perspective of viewing things and on your own personal way o thinking and also in the point of life that you are living , me as a student would prefer go with a group of friends and that 's it , but probably in 10 more years i would rather see the city , the history , what it consist of , than just another night out with the guys .

So what i 'm saying it 's that there are certain points of life were you want to do certain things or you do n't , traveling with a tour guide it 's great to see the city for what it is and not only an structure , for what people had lived before in there , so taking a tour guide will depend after all on what your main idea of the trip is , and what the whole point would be after everything !
