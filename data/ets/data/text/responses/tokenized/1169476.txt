Spending time on a holiday tour is the best way to relax oneself from the stress and pressures of work in such a competitive world .
People with lots of time in hand for planning and scheduling tours prefer to travel on their own , but I personally prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

A complete tour pakage reduces my tension of flight confirmation , booking of hotels in cities not known to me and also the head ache of researching about the places that I am going to visit .
Also , I get a chance to meet many interesting people and make new friends from different walks of life which also makes the tour even more exciting and interesting .
It takes care of my spendings as I can budget my trip well allocating appropriately to shopping and other needs and it also saves me from getting cheated in foreign land .

I can visit all the important places of the cities and the guide would help as in knowing about the importance and significance of the places better .
In addition , I could be more involved in the group while travelling which would help me in communicating to a variety of people and enhance my knowlegde horizon socially as well as give me a chance to learn about different minds .
The guide would also personally help in finding happening and other interesting places of the cities which are not the part of the schedule .
It would also help in time management as we have to adhere to the timings scheduled by the tour guide .
Moreover , touring in a group would take take of my personal safety from local residents and their misbehaviour , if any .

In conclusion , I would certainly like to travel in a group captained by a tour guide a I dont have to bother about booking tickets for travelling , staying as well as personal safety .
