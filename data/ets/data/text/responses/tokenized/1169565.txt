I agree with this statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
Successful people are those who keep on doing experiments to make existing things less complicated and they are the ones who develop new things .
For example in earlyman 's time people used to do travelling by carts .
But nowadays we are able to travel overseas .
We use cars , aeroplanes , helicopters .
If man had n't tried new things or man had n't used his innovative mind , he would n't been able to design new and fastest ways of transportation .

Moreover for success taking risk and doing new things is necessary .
For example in my family my mother is a house wife , my grandmother was also a housewife .
But I want to be a scientist , so I am going against our conventional rules and regulations .
I am trying new things which in our family nobody has tried like I am planning to go abroad to get a doctoral degree as my country is a develoding one .
So , I personally believe in the above statement .

We should always try new things and should give innovative things to this world .
Making new technologies by taking risk is they key to success .
For example If nobody had tried going to moon , we wont be able to explore and know how does moon looks and what are the properties of moon .

But sometimes trying new things can be dangerous too .
For example `` Kalpana chawla '' famous astronaut of NASA , died when her spacecraft was coming back to the earth after doing some valuable discoveries .

But in the long run `` Success goes to those people who keep on trying new things instead of sticking to old things '' .
