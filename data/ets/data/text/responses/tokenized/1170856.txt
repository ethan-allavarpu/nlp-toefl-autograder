I agree that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just emphasis on one specific subject .
Students who know more different categories of knowledge , they are usually more open-mind , easier to make friends , and have higher successful rate after guadrated .

In this modern business world , all business can be connected with other categories ' business .
Assuming a student is graduated , and looking a job in a company .
Obviously , if the student says he or she has a BA degree on business , AAS degree on Financial , and some club leaders ; it is ofter get hired easier than only a Dr. financial degree .
This is possible because the higher degree the student has , the student would requires higher wages and more power in the company , but the student can only help the company 's financial department .
However , the other student has some background knowledge of business and financial , so this student could be able to help the company in two departments , which this student comes more valuable and useful .

Moreover , the student who have broad knowledge of different subjects has more oppoturnity to get a better job , and be able to make more money .
The multi-knowledge helps people easier to make friends especially if you have some common interests with people .
It is a key to make different types of friends around the world .
And these friends might be the one who would give you good life in the future , which means that more the knowledge you have , the more life you get
