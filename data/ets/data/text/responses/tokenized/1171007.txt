Today , many advertisements are making much products .
And they are making profits more than what they suppose to have .
And there is couple reason for it .
First reason is , most advertisements has some kinds of bubble .
The bubble what am I talking about is , the bubble which make advertisements look more fency and more valuable .
For example , they are entertaining themselves so they can show their appearance to people so they can make people think those advertisements are really good and support those advertisements .
Another example is , they are using the commer show .
Many people are spending time for watch the commer shows when they are watcing the television .
And most advertisements are using commer show and entertaintment .
So , most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are .

Second , they are helping each other and make more profits by information or some of helping .
And they are entertaining each other to the other people who do not know about those advertisements really much .
So they got more people and they get more profit and products more than what they suppose to have .

Many advertisements are making products much better than what they suppose to make .
However , I think it is one of the skill for them .
And advertisements are one of member for cycle of economy .
So , I think those are not that bad except some of the other things that so many bubbles .
