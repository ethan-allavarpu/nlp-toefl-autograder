They run with oil when they are in a normal mode .
In this mode they load up the batteries for the electric mode .
After a short ride , especially fast rides ( they produce more energy ) , you can use the elctric motor .
We have to support the technical research to improve inventions like this .
In the future it will be more important to give money for research .

Another point that underlines the theorie , that there are countries in the world , that now begin to have cars .
In China for example it was not common to have a car .
But this countrie is so increasing , that in future they will have millions o
