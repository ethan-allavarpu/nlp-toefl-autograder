For as long as this sophisticated society has existed , people have debated which advertisements effectively work to attract consumers .
Although this issue may never resolved to everyone 's satisfaction , the matter is very clear in my mind : I disagree with this statement .
Many advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are .

That not all advertisements success to attract consumers is evident for several reasons .
To begin with , some advertisements discourage people to purchase the products .
To illustrate , in many countries , the advertisements of tobbacos have warming sentences on them .
When I traveled in Australia , I detected that even the photos of lung cancers were used in the advertisements .
In this case , the advertisements warn us the possibility of danger that is caused by using the products .
Indeed , the advertisements of tobbacos do not makes products better .

Furthermore , some advertisements utilize an unique strategy to attract consumers .
For example , Yukiguni-maitake , Japanese food products company , uses the conspicuous strategy : Its advertisement says that do not buy its products .
This advertisement is unusual , therefore , many consumers are attracted and finally buy the products .
In view of this , the advertisements sometimes apply unique strategy which does not appeal merits of the products .

Nevertheless , some critics claims that the advertisements ' role is to appeal the products .
However , the fact , as detailed above , reveals that some advertisements try to prevent customers from buying their products .

In conclusion , I believe that the advertisements usually use different strategies to attract customers .
It is clear from my examples .
