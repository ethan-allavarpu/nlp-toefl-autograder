Responsiblity plays a big role in our life spicifically for older people .
when an young child is having fun and he doe n't care about money , home and issues that happens for any person .
Young poeple think that they still have a good health but when they get older their health will start to go down .
I agree with young people who want to have fun more than older people for couple reasons .

First of all , responsiblity as I mentioned in the beginning , makes any person thinking about how to make his life more confident and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything he wanted to do .
For example in any family , the father always think about how to get money for his children , the mother looks after the children and tries to help her husband financially .
If we look at the children , we can notice that they want to play everyday and have fun without thinking about anything .
That was a good example of showing the difference of how young and old people act .

Second reason , old people always start to take care of their health which absoultly goes down as they get older .
In the other hand , young people think about no resposibilty and no problems with their health , so why do n't they enjoy their lives before anything happens in the future .
For example , if someone who is 60 years old and he is retired from his job , he could have health problems refuses him to enjoy his life .
Another man who is 20 years old , who just finished his high school and he wants to play sports and going out with his friends without any health problems thats if we ignore the exceptinals like the handicaps .

Finally , i agree with young people to have fun with their life before they get older because they will have more responsibilties more than before .
Also , no body knows about his health and how good its going to be .
I hope everyone enjoys his life whether he is olde or young .
