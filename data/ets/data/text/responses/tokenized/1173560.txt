I believe that is very difficult to understand ideas and concepts and it is simpler and faster to learn facts .
in my opinion , you can understand a fact without knowing ideas and concepts about it but you ca n't understand ideas if there are not fact and practical examples that support the idea !

It is difficult to understand ideas because they are made by other people with concepts and ways of thinking different from yours .
And also , people have different ideas on different arguments , so is not possible to explain or to describe something in one way or in one idea , everyone can have various and different ideas .

Ideas can often be manipulated by people who want their idea to be dominant .
A fact , to the contrary , ca n't be changed , it is the same for everybody and his evidence proves that it can not be change .

A fact can also be funny , scary , interesting . ..
it can give an emotional impression which is easier to remember then an idea .
If student learn facts , they can make connections between those facts and ideas and concepts that they already have .
On my way of thinking , for example , learning fact is very important while one is studying history : when children learn history about Nazism and Holocaust , they ca n't understand the meaning of this words if they do n't know what happened , so , they ca n't understand if they do n't know the facts !

Tis could happen also in other subject like biology : concepts and idea are mad only after a fact has been observed !
Only after knowing facts it 's possible to figure out the meaning of the concepts .
Ideas have to be supported by fact !
The first step and the more efficient way to learn is to know and learn facts .
