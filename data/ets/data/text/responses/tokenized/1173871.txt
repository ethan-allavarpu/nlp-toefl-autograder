We all know that cars can represent ones status , and that is nothing about how the price it is or how convenient the public transportations are .
Thus , I disagree with this topic by following three reasons .

I do not agree with this topic because , first , cars will less polluted to the enviroments in twenty years .
Teconology is going more and more advanced now .
In the future , we will not use gas or petroleum to drive the car .
We will use electicity to replace the gas or petroleum .
Thus , the air will goes fresh , and the greenhouse effect will decline as well .
This will make enviromental group to support people to drive .

I do not agree with this topic because , second , when you drive a car , you can feel calm , save , and warm .
You can drive to anywhere with your family , just wherever they want to arrive .
You can have your own space that public transportations could not give you .
You can also not be bothered from other people when on the way to your destination .
This reason is really important to the person who has family or children .

I do not agree with this topic because , third , you can show the status you are .
For instance , you can drive Benz to buy the fruits or vegetables , and that will make everyone know that you are rich .
Also , when you meet your old friends , which means you are invited from old friends , you can let them know that you are not the one before !
I know this sounds like arrogant , but it is practical right ?

To sum up , many people might advocate another opinion .
However , according to the three main reasons I said , I totally disagree with the topic that in twenty years the cars will less .
