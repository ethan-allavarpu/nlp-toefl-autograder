I am completely positive about the statement .
Here i would like to mention some reasons why a group travel is the best way to travel .
I work for a travel company as a tour guide , so i guess i confirm advantages of group travelling .

First of all , tourists feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide , who is a local resident of the site .
Group travelling people can defend themselves in time difficult times and it is more likely to acttract public attention for requesting for help .
In some places , it is suggested to tourists not to go out alone because of high velocity rate .

Second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel cost .
Needless to say , it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain countries .
Even a number of tour companies offer special programmes for group tourists , not only discounts , but also free-of-charge trips for group leaders or certain amount of members .
The third reason serves our company 's main goal , More people , more fun .
It is much interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation .
Group tourists can attend different competitions , matches and other attractive entertainment .

Travelling is not only the meaning of to travel , but to make friends and to get relationship with them .
It offers people more chances to make friends in an easier way .
I know of many occasions that tourists get marry after a long , exciting tour .

in conclusion , i have a strong point of view of travelling as a group .
Tourists feel more secure , more respect and guides feel more responsibility when they are travelling as a group .
