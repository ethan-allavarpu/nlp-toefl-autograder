Doing what you already can its surely a save way .
It allows you to concentrate on one topic and be as good as you can in it .
You professionalice and may become an expert if you are doing what you really want to do and if you are totaly satisfied with it .

But in my opinion , it is sometimes better to take risks and try something new .
Even if you are happy with your work or living situation you can become even better and happier by gaining new experiencing .

Moving to a foreign country , Studying abroad or learning a nother language .
It opens up your horizon and lets you experience new situations and possibilitys , you would probably not be able to experience .
Living in a different country for example , lets you not just learn about something new , it shows you also a lot about your own country or heritage .
It helps to better understand cultural missunderstandings and about yourselfe , by experiencing several different situations or activitys makes you more diverse and spreads your possibilities .

You can use the experiences at your work , hobby or private life .
You become a wholer person and contribute that to society .
You are able to talk about a fariety of topics and form your life more interressting and make it more We never stop learning and should try to learn as much as we can do about the world .
