The term `` Successful '' is related to getting goals and dreams , but to get a goal means to take a risk , to do new things .
So that is why succesful people like to take risks , because they know they can take the opportunity and explote it to the maximum , and thats how they go ahead and with a risk there is always a finish line , the goal , so when succesful people sees that goal in their lives they see it and do not look back or look both sides , they keep its mind to what they want and that is why they get success .

Now at days successful people take risk , try new things and opportunities , opportunities in which they have to try new things , opportunities in which they will earn experience because they do not do only what they do best , instead they are in search of new capacities they dont even know they have .

For example Bill Gates , he was a man that one day woke up and decided to take a risk , a new opportunity , a new thing , something that no one has thinked about it , maybe at those days when Microsoft did n't exist people thought that Bill Gates was crazy , but they did n't know what would that decision make him what he is today .
Bill Gates is successful now at days because he took an opportunity that anybody else wanted to grab .

I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because we have to go out to the world and explore new things to see if we are good in other things , because there is a lot of people that has being successful just for taking risks , so that means we can do it to , we just have to decide to do it and DO IT and keep our mind and our eyes focused on the goal we want to reach .
