There are heated disscussion about that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Some people support it , by claim that , young people have more friends than older people do .
they are full of energy , and so on .
However , some people against this , saying that older people have more children to share happiness and sadness , and also older people have a lot of actities to take part in .
As far as I am concerned , both young people and the old people energy life .

As we know , young people in school have a lot of time .
they can play with them .
talk with them , and study with them .
School offers a wonderful stage for young to enjoy their life .
In addition , When young people have some problem , a lot of people could give them a hand , such as , their parrents , teachers , partners , bosses , and so on .
By their help , the can solved the problems more productive .
The young people can sure benefit from that , they also can energy better .
Finily , young people have more energy to engoy their life .
They can do whatever they want to do , they can experience a lot of new things that older people have never seen .
Such as computers vidio games .
MSN , ICQ and so on .

On the other hands , older people also enjoy their life .
With the developments of science and thenology , the condition of people living enviroment become better and better .
The older people can liveing longer and longer than before .
The older people become more and more energy and healthier than before .
What 's more , the older people can enjor the wonderfull time with their childen , their grandchildren who can bring a lot of interesting and funny things to their parents or grantpatents .
Also , the community of people 's living becomeing better and better , older people can take part in lots of activities .
Older people can singing with other older people , they can dance , and whatever they want to do .

Sweeping generationlize to this is impossiveble here .
I n a world .
I think both young and old are enjroy their life better and better .
