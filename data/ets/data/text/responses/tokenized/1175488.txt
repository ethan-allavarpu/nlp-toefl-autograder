I believe that people who take risks are successful and smatter as well because life is all on taking risk especially on todays society were its all about the compitition .
For example if the college admission person sees an application with someone who has done what every else has done as in requirements they will be dissapointed with the student .
When they see someone who has done things that have never done before they will only not be impress but they will take a chance as well .
If you already know how to do a expirement you should try to improve it by taking a risk and actually doing something much defferent .
Also if you want to be the owner of a restaurant and you really want this to be the best selling retaurant and you are diciding where there you name the place a name of a well known chain of restaurant or you could take a chance and find originality by naming it something thing else .
If you become successful that way you will feel proud of your creativity and if you do n't become so successful at list you will feel proud that you failed with your own idea .
This is what makes you defferent from someone else originality a risk take is what succeds in life .
Knowing how to do something is one step closer to taking a risk and being more success then you were when you found out you knew how to do something .
The next step is making it original and being proud of the possitive results or negetive in some cases .
Being a brain cancer survivor has taught me that taking risks in your life is the best way to live life .
I took some risks in the hospital and know here I am being successful .
