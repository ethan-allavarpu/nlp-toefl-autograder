Taking risks and trying new things have in common one thing : they are scary or , at least , they are not as comfortable as doing always the same things .
Yet , I am conviced that they are necessary in order to be successful .

Risking can be frightening - I will not deny it .
However , if you do not risk , you miss important opportunities to improve your condition .
Every decision in life , from everyday to once-in-a-lifetime ones , implies some risk .
If you are not able to take risks , this means that you are not able to take challenging decisions , with the obvious results .

Furthermore , in certain situations , taking a risk can make the difference between someone who just accepts what he or she has ( but might regret what he or she has not ) and someone who is really satisfied .
Just think of a recently graduated student who receives a very interesting offer which requires moving to another country : should he stay home and try to find an average job or accept it ?
I am convinced he should accept it and leave straight away , otherwise he might simply regret it for the rest of his life .

On a less personal level , there are contests where trying new things is almost mandatory .
This is the case for example of researchers : questioning the status quo , trying out different possible solutions is necessary in order to find out new things - and where would the world be wihtout new inventions ?
I can not imagine a researcher who does not want to try new things .

For all these reasons , I am conviced that successful people are those who are not afraid of risking .
People who just keep doing what they are good at just miss out opportunity - because that is what a change really is .
