In response to the statement given sideways , I express my approval for it .
Young people nowadays seem to be more interested and involved in their own life and problems than the community as a whole .

The present day world has undergone a dramatic change than it used to be , say a generation ago .
It has become much more competitive and demanding .
The advent of globalisation has led to drastic repercussions .
In today 's world only the best can survive .
Recently an article was there in newspaper on globalisation .
It was stated there that globalisation is producing rich countries with poor people not only in developing countries but also in developed countries like the United States .
The fruits of globalisation are mainly distributed among the rich and the highly skilled persons .
Unskilled and less skilled labor are no longer the recipients of these fruits .

This puts an immense pressure on young people to achieve great skill in whatever art they are pursuing .
They could not devote enough time for other causes , like any work related to the upliftment of their communities .
For them their own survival is the key issue .
They want to be a part of the ongoing globalisation .

Moreover , they do not find any potential benefit in lending a helping hand to their communities .
All they can think of is their own well-being .
Whether they are getting any output by doing so , is what the young people 's thinking is .
In short , the world has become much more materialistic .

Also young people lacks the sense of responsibility which prevents them in helping their communities .
They think that just by being a part of a community and following its rules and regulations is sufficient .
They have forgotten the fact that with rights comes duties .

So , I would once again like to support the statement that young people are not giving enough time in helping their communities .
