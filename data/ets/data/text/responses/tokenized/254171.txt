When it comes to having a Klowledge , it has been a controversial issue whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Som people may insist that it is better to have specialize in one specific subject becuase sometime unsure informations make dangerous situations .
As for me , however , I think having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous for two following reasons : not only it is more practical but also it is helpful when people socialize with others .

First of all , having a various knowledge is kind of practical way .
People would face some problems which they are not specialized , but even though people are not professor about the subject , at leat if they familiar with the subjects they may can deal with that .

In addition , it can help people to socialize with others easier .
People meet a lot of people while they live .
And they engage various fields .
However , when people meet who works in diffrent field , if people know about others fields , they can have talk .

For example , my brother has broad knowledge of many academic subjects . !
year ago , he went to trip to China , and he made a lot of friends .
Because he have various knowldege it was easy to have a conversation with others .
So he had a great time .

All things comsidered , it is not a balck - or - white issue which way is better , i strongly
