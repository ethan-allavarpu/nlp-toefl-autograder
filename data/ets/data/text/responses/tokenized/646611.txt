I disagree with the statement that Nowadays Young people should not participated in Community programs .
Becuse nowadays most of the people are educated and they are realized and planning in what way they can help to the people .
Recently Tsunami occured in srilanka , at that time group of engineers from india went to that place and helping for their construction of shelters and arranged the necessary goods like food , clothing for them .
Because `` Servicing to the people is Servicing to the God '' .

Moreover , many colleges are part time colleges .
So , students have enough time to participate in NSS ( National social services ) programs .
Since government encourage this program in our country in such a way that every one should participate in cultural programs .
I have also participated in NSS programs .
When I was participted I was always `` Cloud nine '' .
I gave suggestions to my friends and they are also participated in many activities .

For other instance , Most of the american people participated in rebuilding of Afganisthan , most of them are young , Do n't you think ? .
In my opinion Nowadays people motivate themselves , spend most of their past times for helping to the people .
Because of formar legislators and politicians has explained how people should respond in critical situations .
Finally I concluded that Nowadays young people undersand the situations and are very well respond in relative situations .
