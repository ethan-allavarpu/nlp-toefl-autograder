Some people may say that they need to broaden their knowledge in many different subjects to get more chances .
But I believe that it is more important to be specialize in one specific subjects than knowing little about everyting because of two reasons .
Which is that it is a waste of time and effort and that the company wants a specialist in certain field .

First of all , studing all the subjects that you do n't need is a waste of time and effort .
People are living in a busy life and I think that they should put these effort and time to their majors .
For example , in Korean high school we have a lot of subjects that you do n't really need .
Students do n't understand why they are learning this but they are studying for these subjects just because of the exam .
I think that students should instead put their time and effort in the fun activities or hobbies that they like to do .

Secondly , thesedays the companys need specialists who are good at one specific field .
This is becoming popular because most of the colleges have many programs that the students can just get into college with one subject that they are really good at .
These subjects can be such as computer skills , launguages ability , arts and ect .
Thus , if you are way better at English than most of your friends , you can develop on your language skills to be better at it and you will become a specialist that many company wants to hire .

Because of these reasons I think that having a subject which you are extremely good at is better than being just good at many subjects .
I believe that each every one has different interests and talents which should be encouraged to be develop .
