It is well known that gazoline is the main driver in car production .
in fact , if the gazoline cost too much , people will less be likely to buy cars .
As a result two potential hypothesis concerning the future of cars can be find .
First , the decrease of gazoline will limited the numbers of cars .
Second a new powerfull subtitued will be find .

To answer the question : ` will the number of decrease within twenty years ?
` , this essay will explain the two hypothesis , their consequenses and it will conclude buy answering the statement .

The first hyppothesis stating that a decrease in gazoline supply will decrease the number of cars .
It is comon sence .
If the gazoline suplly is limited the price will goes up .
As a result comsuption and demand will goes downs down .
In twenty years , people will find-out that having a car and especially with gazoline into it has becomes a luxury good .
People , individuals , will not be a afford the new prices of gazoline , only major firms or government .

The second hypothesis is more relevant .
Find new sources of energy is possible .
We already develop the nuclear which is of course not the best solution for cars but show how human been can find alternative solution .
The ` ethanol ' which is a comple nature source of power can be a solution for cars .
What we need to underline concerning the Ethanol is that the smoke created out of the car using it is horrible .
it just smell very bad .
unless a solution concerning the smell is find it will not be the best solution .
Entire cities of Ethanol 's car can not be .

To conclude , I belive that the number of cars will decrease within the next twenty years .
Alternative solution are possible but , not easy to find and use .
However , the price of the alternative powers or the comon gazoline will be high or going up .
As a result , the number of cars can only decrease with time .
Lets not forget that numbers of cars must decrease unless the hole earth will suffer .
