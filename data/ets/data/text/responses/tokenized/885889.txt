In my opinion it may be better to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects rather than having knowledge on a single subject and it may not be true always ..

First , i believe this because now a days the competition is more .
It may be touf to compact with this competition we must have our leg on different areas .
For example take a company it wll prefer the employee who done a business course and degree course rather than the person with only degree course .
This is because they think that he wll be usefull to the organisation more than the later .

second , Every subject we learn wll be usefull to us in our life at a point .
For an instance take mathematics it wll be usefull for us to calculate the sum , measure measurments etc .
So if a man have knowledge on only one subject it wll be hard to survive the life .
And he shold depend on others for simple reasons .

Third , Some subjects may be disappear .
This is because lak of intreset in that particular subject .
Take a subject that is not intrested by many of the students for example history .
Many people donot like the history subject because they feel it bit boring .
If they donot have a knowledge on history then there may be the consequences like forgetting our old traditions , cultures completely .
Which may not be good .

Although we must have a broad knowledge on many subjects we should be perfect in a specific subject that is our intreset of study .
By getting a minimal knowledge of the all subjects may answer all the question posed above .
But itself wll not be sufficent .

The advantages of having a knowledge on a specified subject are as follows .
By getting more information on the particular subject may help us to built our carrier more systamatically .
Not only that by having a more knowledge on one subject helps us to motivate developing new ideas .
We may know the erros generally done by the people and we may solve them easily effectively and more efficiently .

So we have advantages in both of the statements ! .
so i like to solve the problem by saying that `` It would be good to have a knowledge on subjects to all subjects in young age say before graduation and have a knowledge on specific subject from the graduation which will sounds good for all the answers '' .
