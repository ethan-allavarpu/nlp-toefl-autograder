Imaging your are enjoying your delicious meal when clouds of smoke surrounds you and a heavy smoker right beside you speaks out, whose breath is of tobacco. How will you feel at this moment and this place? You certainly lose your appetite and intend to escape from the man as soon as possible, will you?For me, I think that under no circumstances should smoking be allowed in public places, such as the restaurant. Reasons are as follows. First of all, it does no good for your health. Both the smoker and the second hand smokers are risking their health even their life on the cigarette. Every year, large amounts of people die of lung cancer just because of smoking too much. Everyone should realize that our life is really precious that it our duty to value it. Therefore stay away from the cigar not only for yourself but also for others surrounding you. Secondly, it is a bad behavior or habit for our adolescents to imitate. Smoking in front of others present is a bad manner, which not only make an awful impression on others' mind but mislead the children to regard it as an acceptable or even a cool action. Every adult should be mentally alert to set a good example, especially in the public place. In a word, let's create a smoke free atmosphere to enjoy our meal. Seriously speaking! No smoking at any restaurant in the country!
