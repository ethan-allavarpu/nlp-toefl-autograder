According to the Chinese governments' announcement, smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country since Jan. 1, 2011. People have been discussing heatedly heather this ban should be taken into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial to them. But for smokers, they think it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. First of all, for many customers, who spend much money in going to the restaurants, they just want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time here, but with the irritating smoke surrounding them, how can they feel comfortable? What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second hand smokers. On one hand, the burning tobacco smoke contains more than 20 kinds of toxic hazards to life, among which the nicotine is the largest killer that can increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer greatly. On the other hand, scientists find that non-smoker experience psychological harm as well, when they are exposed to the smoke, their levels of depression and anxiety is increasing. Eventually, let us look at the statistics showing that thousands of fire accidents are due to the litter of non-extinguished cigarette ends, not to mention the related deaths and losses. So, mo smoking, no crying!Taking all the factors into account, I stick to the ban that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
