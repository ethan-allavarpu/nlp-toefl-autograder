Recently several bans, forbiding smoking in all restaurants, have been published, which brings heated discussion. As far as I'm concerned, to those bans I can't agree more. The reasons are just as followed:First and foremost, smoking is basically harmful to people's health, especially to the lung, which can contribute to fatal disease, such as cancer. Secondly, restaurant is a public occasion, smoking there can not only hurt smokers themselves, but also do harm to those surrounded. What's worse, while there is pregnant woman in the restaurant, the harm can be catastrophic. Thirdly, smoking can lead to quarrelling, which will destroy the harmony and influence consumers' mood in the restaurant. For there are also many non-smokers, even some smoking-sensitive people. Last but not least, even considering that several smokers have been addicted in smoking, there are still many other space out of restaurant provided for them. All in all, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurant in the country. In order to realize this aim, it is not enough that only the government publish some bans. Citizens, both smokers and non-smokers, are ought to join in this compaign. Smokers can remind themselves that it is banned to smoke in the restaurant when they have the desire to take a cigarette out. Non-smokers can advice those who want to smoke during dinner not to do that instesd of just tolerating or direct quarelling. Only in that way can smoking be completely banned in all reataurants in the country.
