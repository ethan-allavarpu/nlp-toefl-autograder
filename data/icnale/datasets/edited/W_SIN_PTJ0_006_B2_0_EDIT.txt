I find it hard to make a generalization about whether or not it's important for college students to have a part-time job because this seems like something very personal and highly dependent on the individual student and their circumstances. Jobs serve a few main functions: to earn money, to gain experience, to get a head-start in a career, and to have something to do. Whether or not it's important for a given college student to have a part-time job would thus be dependent on how important those various factors are for them. A poor student, for instance, would find a (paying) job beneficial or even necessary to meet their financial needs, and would find such a job more important than it would be for a rich student who does not have to worry about finances. Alternatively, a student might take up a job to gain experience and expand their horizons beyond academia, and consider this an important pursuit. Another student might, however, find the time spent on a job to be better spent on their college work, studying and getting the best grades that they can, so as to be able to (ideally) get a better job in the future. Yet another student might wish to enjoy their last few years of freedom before entering the workforce, and find it more important to have free time to spend on leisurely pursuits rather than a job. Meanwhile, a final hypothetical student might be already struggling with their college work (with or without additional commitments), and getting a job would further jeopardize their ability to cope. As such, while having a part-time job would be important for some college students, this assertion cannot be universally applied to all students.
