Nowadays many students tend to get a part-time job outside school. According to a recent survey, there is a dramatic increase in the number of students who devote time to extra-curricular activities, community involvement and part-time work. As students attach more importance to part-time job, is it virtually significant to do that?As far as I'm concerned, taking a part-time job is of necessity. In the first place, through working with other people, students can learn how to get well with others. It is a chance to develop interpersonal communication and the ability of settling problems with a team. In the second place, college students usually focus on academics, but known rarely about the society. Doing a part-time job is good for real life experience. It helps students learn how to adapt to the norms of the society they live in. In the third place, many students spend too much money and make their family under the financial pressure. Even though the majority of students can't accumulate much wealth from the job, it helps their parents to release from the burden to some extent. We do know that time is the most valuable and the most perishable of all our possessions. To my thinking, we should arrange our time properly to do part-time job and study hard at the same time. We should make sure that we put ourselves on a more competitive footing when we leave college.
