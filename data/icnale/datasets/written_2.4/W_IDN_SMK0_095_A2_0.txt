Smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in the country. It has some reasons to do that. Firstly, not all the restaurant's costumers are smokers. The restaurant where we want to come has many costumers and only some of them are smokers, so it makes the inconvenient and uncomfortable condition. Especially to the unsmoker costumer which would like to eat there. Secondly, the smell of the surrounding becomes bad. The smoke which is resulted from the burning cigarette is bad. The research had proven that it contains of CO, nikotin, and tar. It usually makes the passive smokers feel dizzy. Thirdy, smoking has more disadvantages than advantages. For example, smoking makes us spend more money to buy cigarette, smoking has spent our time just to do smoke. This disadvantage not only stopped from that fact. More frightening fact comes from health side. Researchers have done experiments and as their result, smoking can cause cancer, heart attack, impotence, cough, lung disease, and other unwanted disease. Fourthly, those disadvantages not only attack active smokers, but also passive smokers who have direct contact with active smokers, especially in smoke. For example, in a family only one person who doesn't smoke, and he always has direct contact with active smokers automatically. As the effect he/ she can be attacked by the diseases which should attack active smokers. The toxin which are resulted from the burning cigarette are accumulated in the body and becomes disease too. Fifthly, smoking donates air pollution, although in a little number. This pollution is caused by smoke which contains CO and CO2. In the atmosphere, CO2 can be neutralized by plants during photosynthesis process, but neither can CO. From those reasons above, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in the country.
