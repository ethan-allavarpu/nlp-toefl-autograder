And some of them do not think paying money to collage. They do not study at all the time. they are playing. This situation is funny. They should more thinking about what they do in the collage. So, I think part-time job chance they think. About second reason, I feel so very much. Pert time job link various people, example young and old. They have owed thinking. We study several ideas. If college students to not have a part-time job, they do study? I do not think so. Almost students will be idle. I think they need to have purpose. Example, a man who is an idle student made have a part-time job by his parents. He keeps doing. He saved up money. Then he must thinking.
