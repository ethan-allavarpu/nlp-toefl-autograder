I agree with the statement. I have two reasons. First, I think they can learn a part of society. Of course, they can't learn it completely. But, it is important to know society. When they graduate university, without knowing it, they will confuse. They may make mistakes from it. Second, they can get some skills. For example, skill of communication, expert or general knowledge. Perhaps, the knowledge which they get to have a part time job are influenced their future. Especially, I think skill of communication is very important. Of course, there is difference of skill of it. But, in our life, we can't live without communication. It is base of life. And, it is sure that the person who has high ability of it is liked. I tell you two reasons I agree with this statement until now. But, I want to except a case. We are university students. We passed the hard entrance examination to study something. If they can not study because of part time job, I don't agree this statement. Part time job is said arbeit by Japanese. I think this word arbeit come from German. The word is arbeiten. This word means work in English. But, when students use this word, it means study in English. So, the work of students are studying. We enter this university to study. From this reason, I think studying is first priority and part time job is second. Therefore, in this case, I disagree with it.
