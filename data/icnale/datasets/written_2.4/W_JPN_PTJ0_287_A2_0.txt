I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. It is because the experience to work and to get money with themselves may make the college students growing up. Angering their boss and missing their job may give them rich spirit. After they become the member of society, they will enjoy and leave wonderful achievement. If they don't have a part-time job when they are the college students, some of them will be worthless people. They don't know the society. They don't know that it's importance to get money with working. Of course, some of the college students who don't work know that important view. But, many of the college students may not know. I think. Other reason of the importance of a part-time job is simply. College students need much money. Whether they stay home with their family or not, they may want to enjoy the college life. It may be the play, study and love. Anyway, they need much money. So they must have a part-time job. Finally, I think, it is not only the college students but also society to want the college student to have a part-time job. The college students are the element of society, too. If none of them worked, society might not exist.
