I agree the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Certainly, some people disagree this idea and think college students should spend the time instead the time of a part-time job. But, I have three reasons of agreement. First, I think a part-time job makes my independence. I notice the independence of money by earning by myself. So I thank my parents since I started a part-time job. Second, I made friends for a part-time job. There are fifteen college students and four students of all students are students of *** University. All people get along with well. My teacher said me, Why don't you do a part-time job of teaching? Teaching is high salary. Indeed, my salary of part-time job is 900 yen an hour. But I'm satisfied with my salary because I can make friends of various university. Finally, I noticed the real independence of word 'Arigatou!!'. My part-time job is waiting on customers. Before I started my part-time-job, I thought I can't speak my customers well. But I could speak my customers now. And I could notice the independence of 'Arigatou!!'. If my customers don't say anything when I bring dishes to my customers, I feel dislike and uneasiness. If they say me 'Arigatou!!', I'm very very happy!! So I want to service the customer well more and more!! This experience makes me say 'Arigatougozaimasu!' in other stores. Therefore I agree this idea very much!
