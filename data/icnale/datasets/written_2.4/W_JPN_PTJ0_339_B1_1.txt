I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have two reasons. First, a part-time job gives good experience to us. For example, a tutor teaches subject to a high school student or a junior high school student. The tutor may think teaching is difficult. Even if the student can't understand, the tutor has to make every effort to make the student understand. That's because the tutor is given money. We can learn an importance and responsibility of working. Second, college students need a lot of money. Their parents usually pay much money for a course fee, house rent and others. The parents suffer from this money. In addition, the students wear different clothes every day. When I was high school student, I wore uniform. It was very easy for me to decide what clothes I should wear in high school. Then I didn't have to have a lot of clothes. Now, I need many clothes. I need a lot of money for clothes. If we don't have a part-time job, we have difficulty in lack of money. It is bad not to study at all for too much job. If we can do both study and a part-time job, we should have a part-time job.
