Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with this idea. There are three reasons why I can't agree with the ban on smoking. First, I don't smoke because I hate this smell. When someone smokes, I feel sick and my clothes get annoying smell. I can't bear this smell, and its state. Second, perhaps this may be a prejudice that smoking people don't have good manners because smoking seems to be bad manners in Japan. So I consider someone smokes at restaurants to be a nasty. At last, smoking does harm not only smokers' health but non-smokers'. My mother would not smoke but in her office some people are heavy smoker. So she is a passive smoker. She perhaps will get a lung cancer in the future. I think that this behavior is a crime. Needless to say I strongly feel that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan. However, I think that it is impossible to be banned at all restaurants in Japan. I want to insist it is the truth that someone really hates smoking like me. So I want them to think about non-smokers. To keep good manners make good circumstance, I think.
