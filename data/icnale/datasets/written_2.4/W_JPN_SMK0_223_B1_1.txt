I disagree this statement that smoking is banned at all the restaurants. I have two reasons for this. First, restaurants are where people have dishes with relaxing. All people have right to enjoy eating. Of course, smokers aren't exception. They deserve to smoke after eating. Nobody can disturb their leisure. Indeed, smoking harms human's health. For example, smoking causes lumber cancer, pulmonary emphysema etc. That's not all. Tobacco's smoke is poisonous for surrounding people who don't smoke. The room's air is becoming dirty and stink. But these problems are solved if seats are separated for smokers and non-smokers. Smokers understand smoking's damage and select smoking. Non-smokers need not get secondhand smoking. That is, not at all the restaurants but at part of the restaurants, smoking should be banned. And second, if smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, the number which smokers go to restaurants will be decreasing. That's because they will come to eat where they can smoke, for example, at home or at office. Reduction of customers has a malign influence upon profit of restaurants. Since the food service industry support Japanese economy, Japanese economy will be dealt a heavy blow to and may fall into disorder. In a word, the policy isn't good. Arguments for and against smoking should be decided by each people. Tobaccos are taste for some people. It shouldn't be banned unnecessarily. That's why I don't support the statement.
