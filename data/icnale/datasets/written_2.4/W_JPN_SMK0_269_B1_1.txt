Some people enjoy smoking, though they know that some bad substances which are contained in cigarette, for instance nicotine, tar and so on, affect their health. They, especially heavy smokers, may be irritated if they can't take a smoke, while taking meals or after. If smoking is forbidden at all restaurants, I think only nonsmokers and light smokers enjoy meals. But I want the heavy to have a good time too not only at lunch time but also at morning or at dinner. But other people hate completely cigarette's smell or smoke. That's smoke affects those around the smoker as a passive smoker. As the means of an elimination of passive smoking, there is banning on smoking at restaurants, separating of the seats, or having equipments for filtering bad substances from the air. So it is no wonder that smokers' area is separated from nonsmokers' at restaurants these days. This is one simple means of keeping nonsmokers from affects of passive smoking. All restaurants should have also some machines that can change the foul air to the fresh air, for example an air cleaner. If so, at the same place nonsmokers and smokers can eat together. I don't think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in Japan, if there are some rules or equipments for smoking like these.
