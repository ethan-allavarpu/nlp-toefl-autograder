I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have two reasons to the opinion. First, smoking in the public space is too danger. Because, a cigarette brings us bad effect. My boyfriend has a asthma. When he absorbs much cigarette smoke, he can has a spasm. In the worst case, he can die. I think that you should know a existence of such a person. Smoking is a very danger for such a person. To be sure, some people want to smoke after dinner. But, it is a matter of life and death for other people. I want some people who want to smoke after dinner to go to a smoking space or go out and smoke. And, a cigarette injures all of us. It's not so good to the public. Second, it has bad smell. My mother is smoker. But she always says when we go to a restaurant, Our dishes become a bad taste because of a smoking smell. Even smoker don't like a smoking smell! Of cause, I also dislike the smell. Restaurant is a eating space. Not smoking space. That's way I consider that smoking at the restaurants is bad. And, it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.
