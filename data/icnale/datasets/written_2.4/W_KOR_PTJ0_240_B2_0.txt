College students are at the stage of being an adult. Being an adult means being independent in terms of mentally, physically, and economically. Therefore they need to practice to make money step by step. And having a part-time job is a good way to practice it. College students need to earn money because they start to independent from their original family. After graduate high school, usually they are treated as an adult, and it pushes college students to have opportunity to have a job. However, because they have to study at college, I think a part-time job is better than full-time job. Although the money is smaller than full time job, they can experience work field. Further, they can learn work ethics from their work. Second, experiencing real work field let them know themselves. For example, they can find their aptitude from the work experiences. And it is possible to lie down a specific job when it does not match with one's aptitude. In my case, I could realize my aptitude from internship on my summer vacation. Third, while working in the real field, students can learn what to study more to get a real job. Students are the people who have the opportunity to learn more. Though the ability student has now is not perfect, he/she has the chance and time to make up. And I think a part time job provides the chance.
