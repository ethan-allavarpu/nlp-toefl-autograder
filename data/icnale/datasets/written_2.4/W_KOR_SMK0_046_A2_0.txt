I agree opinion that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are too many non-smoking area in the restaurant. There are restaurant well observe the law. But, the rule in many restaurants is widely ignored. The smell of smoke is very harmful to nonsmokers. Many people are damaged from second-hand smoking. What are the effects of second-hand smoke? Second-hand smoke can cause life-threatening diseases such as lung cancer. So, secondhand smoking is very bad to health. I have bad remember in a restaurant. When we were eating delicious food, man was smoking continue towards me at the next table, I really hate a smoke smell. The restaurant provides a good service and taste good. But, I was getting a very bad headache from the smoking smell. Smoker doesn't know any shame. They have a lot of shameless. Also, they got no consideration for others. If smokers want to smoke, they will have to go outside. They Also, the restaurant owner should follow the rule exhaustively and not be left to smoking. I want to non-smoking eat delicious meal without suffering. Therefore, I approve opinion that Smoking has to be completely banned at all the restaurants.
