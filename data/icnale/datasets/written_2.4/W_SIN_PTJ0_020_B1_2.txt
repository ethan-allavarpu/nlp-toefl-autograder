I largely agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As many of us may know, studying in a college or a university is very costly if without any scholarships or financial support. If college students does not get a job, this means that they can only get the money from their parents or get a loan. Some may argue that students should just focus on studying and not be obsessed about earning money at this point in time. I beg to differ. College students should get a part-time job as they can learn to be independent especially when they are of a young adult age. By getting a part-time job not only expands one's social circle, it also prepares them for whats coming after university, which is working life. Only by experiencing the difficulties and challenges of a work life, they can then understand the money they have earned was not so easy afterall and spend it thriftly. By just asking parents for money, they may not even know how hard it is to strive in a working life, until they experience it themselves. Thus, in conclusion, i find that it is important for college students to get a part-time job, however, if they are already struggling with balancing both studies and working, they should better manage their time and reduce a little on the working hours.
