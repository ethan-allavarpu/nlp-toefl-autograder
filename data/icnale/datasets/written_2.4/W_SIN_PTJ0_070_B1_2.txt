I agree with this statement to a certain extent. Usually by the time students get to college, their daily allowances given by parents may not be sufficient. This is because there are not as many restrictions for college students as compared to being at a younger age, so they can hang out longer and more often with friends and therefore increasing their expenditures. They are also easily influenced on their wants over needs which may result in overspending. Not all parents are willing to hand out extra cash to their children to satisfy their wants instead of needs. Getting a part-time job helps to sustain their lifestyles and enables them to spend whatever they earn, or there are also others who want to save can save more compared to relying only on their allowances. Some students may also think that they are old enough to take care of themselves and not rely on their parents all the time so they will earn their own allowances by getting a part-time job. Although most students tend to get part-time jobs, there are also those who do not need a job at all because their families have higher incomes and are willing to support and maintain their children's lifestyles. The parents can just give them whatever money they ask for and buy them whatever they want.
