Smoking leads to too many health and social issues that I would have to agree that most restaurants should ban customers from smoking. Under the utilitarian perspective, banning smoking would be better for the greater good. This is because customers may not want to be victim to second-hand smoking. In addition, with the warnings from the health promotion board, schools and other informational brochures about all the harm second hand smoking can cause, non-smokers are more wary and cautious with breathing in smoke. Although one may be able to understand why smokers may have picked up this addiction, they may not necessarily empathize with it. Hence, they may want to enjoy their meal peacefully without having the thoughts of breathing in smoke that may affect their health. In addition, this could also be beneficial for the restaurant as they made it clear to families or health-conscious individuals that their restaurant is strictly smoke free. On the other hand, it is impossible to ban smoking from all restaurants as it boils down to the concept or culture of the place. For example, in Clarke Quay, a location where night activities are most dynamic and lively in Singapore, one can naturally expect that people would like to relax and perhaps smoke a cigarette or two.
