The students of college or university are teenage. They have responsible for everything. After study already, they have part time. So, should to have activity. Something is bad or good but you know? It is interesting. Because it is experience. It is outside of your class. You learn something. The job is good activity because you get strange experience and you can make money. My opinion about past time job of students. Government office should to support very much. Because it is good activity. They spend time for good. Get the many benefits. Like learn social relationship, take care the other people, etc. know what other people want and try to serve them happily. It is the process of training students to be as adults. They will learn from the managers and friends in the work. For example, if customer complaint about the company, how they deal with it. some customer may be unkind and ask for many things. It is how to keep patient and try to clam down but when trying to clam down, they must know the solutions. So I think the students when they have part time job they can be like adults learning how to work and deal with people.
