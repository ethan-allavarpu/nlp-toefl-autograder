In my opinion, I agree that a part time job is important to student college. The students in the college should get some part time job, because they will get money to pay each day. The college students should help there family by work in the part time job, because in the college student might use a lot of money and the money from there parents is not enough for them. Many people in the college might try to get a part time job for earn money to help there parent, because there parent can't give them much money. So this is the good way for people who want to study but have no money. The part time job not only the good way for students who want to get money, but it is the good way for people who want to get more experience. If who want to get more experience should get a part time job. The part time job could give many good thing to students and the part time job couldn't give a bad thing to students. If who want to get more money for help the parents, and want to get more experience, and get more good friends they should go to find a part time job or more than
