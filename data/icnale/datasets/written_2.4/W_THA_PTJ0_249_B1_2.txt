In the world that business plays an important role in people's life, many people have to learn how to make money by themselves. College students have to do a part a time job in order to get some money and help decrease their parent's expenses. Many college students love to follow the fashion and trend. The behavior of Thai students is influenced by friends for example, they use BlackBerry mobile phone or we called BB. Now, Thai students believe that if they have BB, they will be praised by their friends. For the students who don't have BB, they will not accepted by their friends. This problem causes the students to beg for a large amount of money from their parents. In my opinion, I think that if the students want to buy the expensive thing, they should collect the money by themselves. The best way to find money is to do a part time job. There are many part time jobs available for the students. They can work in the department store such as BigC and Lotus, the restaurant such as KFC and McDonalds and the convenient store such as Seven-Eleven. All of these jobs can help them collecting the money to buy the expensive thing. The most important reason is they can also help their parents.
