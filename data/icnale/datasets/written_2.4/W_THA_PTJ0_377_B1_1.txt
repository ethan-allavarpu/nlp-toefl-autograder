It is seems that a part time job is increasing in Thailand. Many University students also work during study. Because it is a good way to make money for paying something necessary for their studying life. Moreover a part time can help the students take responsible and taking care of themselves. I agree with this; the students should have a part time job. So in this essay I'd like to explain in two reasons of important part time job. First is students can make money during study. Second is part time job give us a good experience. Many parents agree with a part time job of their child. Nowadays many family can't afford for their children college. Part time job is a good choice for the teenager who want to study in University, but have no money. It is very easy to find a funny job. The teenager can find a job in fast food restaurant. For example KFC, Mister donut, The pizza etc. Some of my friends only study in University. They never have a part time job during summer or study. When they finish college I think it so hard to learn about work of them. If we have a part time job, we also learn to live with another person in society. We can meet many people and work with them through our service. A good time and experience will teach us in social working life. In conclusion I think a part time job is important for college students. Because it is the base way to prepare their life before get a degree. A pert time job can make us happy and funny during work and it is the first step of our work life.
