I think, smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. First, I feel Smoking is dangerous. Because all years will have many patients died from diseases caused by smoking such as, air bag aneurysms, lung cancer, etc. Smoking is impolite that many people will look smoker so bad person. Now, governments want to smoker down so they make advertising and activities campaigning for people not smoking. In addition, we usually see tag on the wall in public place Don't smoking can be seen that many people don't like smoker. In fact, the government should issue laws controlling smoking in restaurants and public places. In concluding, smoking doesn't have benefits and give harmful for smoker and people around you, too. The policy of the country about smoking in public places is announced in many years and the results is better and better. Many places respects it and don't allow customers to smoke. If police see any restaurants allow customers to smoke, the shop will be punished and the customers will be punished too so that is why the number is not high like in the past. But there are still many restaurants too that they don't follow the policy. What we can do is trying to watch out, keep our eyes on them and try to do our best to stop people to smoke in the restaurants.
