Smoking should be banned for a 100%. I agree if all restaurants agree to ban smoking in their place. Restaurants must be place for eating and enjoy and have a good time with family or friends not eating among smoking around. Health and food are not good with smoking. How to stop people smoke in the restaurants? It is very easy because the owners have that right. If they are strong and not flexible, no one will dare to do it. The warning tag should be in the restaurants too. To tell people not smoke in the restaurants because it harm other people. I think smokers should stop smoking because there are a lot of disease from cigarettes. They will be look older than their age, their breath is very bad smell, lung and heart will be bad and bad, and finally they have canner. It's very suffering if they got sick from smoking. They should know about that. Some of them know but don't take action because they think it is cool. People will like to see them smoke. They are wrong! Smoking make them look bad and not attractive at all. So I think they should think about this carefully so that they can become attractive some day.
