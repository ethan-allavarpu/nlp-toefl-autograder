When it comes to the importance for college students to have a part time job, no one can deny that having some work experiences is good for our future. As a matter of that having work experiences before graduation is benefits for many aspect, including of learning, broad horizon and the plan for future. As far as I concerned, the main reason why I agree students should have a part-time job can be summarized as following points. First of all, in most of western world, parents usually let their children be independence by earning themselves. However, most of students in Taiwan still rely on their parents in daily life. I think that having a part-time job can let children learn independence without their parents. In the second place, the tired and difficultness of parents is easily to be ignored. Having a part-time job is a good chance to let child learn the importance of money. The will make allowance in good use, thinking twice before spend. Last but most importance is that students can learn how to interact with others from having part-time jobs. The process when they work can be a experience and good lesson in their future life. According the reasons I have mentioned above, I agree that having a part-time job is importance for students' colleges.
